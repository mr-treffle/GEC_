      "S CREATING A HABITABLE ENVIRONMENT\n",
      "S Humans have many basic needs and one of them is to have an environment that can sustain their lives .\n",
      "S Our current population is 6 billion people and it is still growing exponentially .\n",
      "S This will , if not already , caused problems as there are very limited spaces for us .\n",
      "S The solution can be obtain by using technology to achieve a better usage of space that we have and resolve the problems in lands that inhospitable such as desserts and swamps .\n",
      "S Some countries are having difficulties in managing a place to live for their citizen as they tend to get overpopulated .\n",
      "S This caused problem like the appearance of slums which most of the time is not safe due to the unhealthy environment .\n",
      "S The only way to satisfy the increasing demands of space is by achieving a better usage of the land like designing taller building so it can accommodate more number of people with the same spaces .\n",
      "S It is also important to create a better material that can support the buildings despite any natural disaster like earthquakes .\n",
      "S A good example is Japan where there are a lot of tall condominiums despite the large number of earthquakes happening in there .\n",
      "S Besides a better usage of lands , a better sanitation is also needed because a huge number of people need a clean environment to maintain their heath .\n",
      "S For example , countries in Africa can accommodate more people if they can manage to design a better sanitation system .\n",
      "S Countries with a lot of inhospitable space need not only to achieve a better space usage , but also to reforms the land to make it livable and technology can help it in a number of ways depending on the trouble the lands have .\n",
      "S For example , countries with a lot of deserts can terraform their desert to increase their habitable land and using irrigation to provide clean water to the desert .\n",
      "S Dubai will be a good example for this as previously the country got almost no natural water and they use irrigation to bring natural water to the country .\n",
      "S Another example is Netherlands , whose most of his lands is a swamp under sea level , have used a good irrigation system to counter their problem and to make their land habitable .\n",
      "S As the number of people grows , the need of habitable environment is unquestionably essential .\n",
      "S In this era , Engineering designs can help to provide more habitable accommodation by designing a stronger material so it 's possible to create a taller and safer building , a better and efficient sanitation system to prevent disease , and also by designing a way to change the condition of the inhabitable environment .\n",
      "S The Factors that Shaped Biometrics\n",
      "S Identification has become more and more important in our society .\n",
      "S Thanks to biometric identification , nowadays , we can open a locked door without keys , withdraw money from the bank without entering password , and travel around the world without taking various cards .\n",
      "S Biometrics , by definition , refers to technologies of measurement and analysis of human body characteristics .\n",
      "S These characteristics include fingerprints , eye retinas and irises , voice patterns , facial patterns and hand measurements .\n",
      "S Besides some technologically determinists that allow the development of biometric identification , this technology is also shaped by three social factors , namely , the desire of the society for safety , convenience and economy .\n",
      "S Safety is one of the crucial problems that many countries and companies concern .\n",
      "S On one hand more and more virus and hack can access personal computers , so the secret data and documents may be stolen .\n",
      "S On the other hand , some important departments need strict administration to their members to avoid information leaks .\n",
      "S The United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) { Common Access Card } [ HYPERLINK : http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Access_Card ] is a successful use of biometric identification .\n",
      "S This card contains biometric data to add security and reduce the risk of falsification ( Ben , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S As we can see , the biometric identification involved in important secure areas is designed to identify human with accuracy and reliability .\n",
      "S Besides safety , convenience is also desirable for identifications .\n",
      "S We do not want to spend time and effort to remember password , neither do we want to carry any cards or equipments to show our identification .\n",
      "S For government and other organizations , they are also looking for small size equipments and time-saving progress of identification .\n",
      "S Therefore nowadays the biometric identification progress is designed to be very quick , and the equipments can be easily set up or can be combined with other equipments .\n",
      "S We can have fingerprint verification reader combined with built-in smartcard reader , and it only takes seconds to verify one 's identification .\n",
      "S Moreover , the society is looking for economic ways of identification .\n",
      "S Therefore , the equipments of biometric identification tend to be in-expensive .\n",
      "S For instance , Retinal Technologies , Inc. ( RTI ) , which captures a retinal image at distances from the user 's eye with the means of just using a patented aspheric lens array .\n",
      "S Hence the RTI system is very inexpensively and can be commonly used ( Retinal Technologies , Inc. Launches Company and Revolutionizes Biometrics With Patented Retinal Scanning Technology , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S The effects of the use of biometric identification are obvious .\n",
      "S With biometric identification , our fingers , faces and even eyes become our identification .\n",
      "S This technology is widely used in our society and it brings benefit to the government , the military , business and every individual .\n",
      "S All in all , biometric identification achieves great development as human seek for better information protection , easier life style and greater economic profit , and it benefits much to those who shaped it .\n",

      "S Nuclear technology had come a long way since Ernest Rutherford first split the atom in 1917 .\n",
      "S The subsequent realization that the additional neutrons produced from fission reaction can induce a nuclear chain reaction sparked off widespread interest in nuclear technology .\n",
      "S Since then , nuclear technology had been through wars , arms races and had found many applications in the medical , industrial and energy fields .\n",
      "S When uranium fission was discovered in 1938 , it sparked widespread scientific interest due to the massive amount of energy released by the reaction .\n",
      "S However most American physicists were still skeptical that it could be turned into a bomb or an energy source .\n",
      "S However , with the world on the brink of war , military considerations would accelerate the development of nuclear technology beyond the imagination of the initial skeptics .\n",
      "S Following fears that Nazi Germany was developing nuclear weaponry , the Manhattan Project was initiated in the United States .\n",
      "S The project eventually grew to include over thirty sites across America dedicated to nuclear research .\n",
      "S The research effort culminated in \" Fat Man \" and \" Little Boy \" , two atomic bombs that were dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima respectively .\n",
      "S Although wartime nuclear research brought about nothing but devastation and death , President Eisenhower 's \" Atoms for Peace \" speech would set the world off on the road of peaceful pursuit of nuclear energy .\n",
      "S The development of nuclear technology was also heavily influenced by public opinion , especially after disastrous accidents occurred in nuclear power stations .\n",
      "S The steady growth of nuclear power in the 1960s was hampered by the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and the growing voices of the anti-nuclear movement .\n",
      "S The leakage of radioactive gas into the atmosphere prompted the many anti-nuclear demonstrations that sprung up across the America in the following months .\n",
      "S Although the reactor was eventually cleaned up and decontaminated , the damaged dealt to nuclear power was irreversible and caused its subsequent decline .\n",
      "S This is especially evident in the steady drop of the number of nuclear reactors built , a statistic that was rising prior to the accident .\n",
      "S With rising oil prices and growing concerns of global warming , countries are looking to nuclear power to solve the energy needs of tomorrow .\n",
      "S China , the factory of the world , consumes phenomenal amounts of energy to fuel its economic growth .\n",
      "S To partly offset this gigantic demand for energy , China had launched an ambitious program to produce 16 % of its electricity from nuclear power by 2030 .\n",
      "S This endeavor to produce more nuclear power have stimulated the development of safer designs of nuclear reactors .\n",
      "S One example is the Pebble Bed reactor , an innovative design that is being actively researched in China .\n",
      "S Safety concerns characterized the basic concept of the Pebble Bed reactor with its passive safety design .\n",
      "S In this design , nuclear fuels are contained in spheres or 'pebbles ' of graphite .\n",
      "S Hence the nuclear fuels are contained in a more stable environment .\n",
      "S When machinery failure occurs and reactor temperature increase to extremely high levels , the reactor does not undergo a meltdown or explode , instead temperature just stays at the high level until the heat can be dissipated or cooled by coolant liquids .\n",
      "S In conclusion , nuclear technology development had always been driven by social factors .\n",
      "S World War 2 had given it momentum in its initial research , but it will be mankind 's need for a renewable and environmentally friendly energy source that will drive nuclear technology 's future developments .\n",
      "S Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is trapping heat within the Earth .\n",
      "S As such , global surface temperature has risen by 0.74 degree Celsius for the past century .\n",
      "S Global warming has brought along devastating problems which will affect the lives of many if ignored .\n",
      "S Engineering can help to address this issue by designing technologies which are capable of producing little or no carbon dioxide .\n",
      "S According to Khandani 's article on 'Engineering design process'1 , there are five steps to designing processes .\n",
      "S First of all , we have to define the problem .\n",
      "S One of the main causes of global warming is the excessive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .\n",
      "S To reduce heat trap within the atmosphere , carbon dioxide level has to be reduced .\n",
      "S Engineers will have to design technologies which keep carbon dioxide emission to the minimum .\n",
      "S Presently in the market , there are already technologies which can replace present day equipments and emit less carbon dioxide .\n",
      "S However these products are not manufactured in large quantities due to high cost of production and low demand .\n",
      "S As such , engineers will have to design technological products which are able to keep both carbon dioxide emission and cost to the minimum , yet perform as efficiently as the present day products .\n",
      "S Second , engineers have to gather relevant information to assist them in generating ideas to tackle the problem .\n",
      "S As the subject has been discussed for quite some time , relevant information are readily available on the internet and articles in magazines and newspapers .\n",
      "S Third , engineers have to generate multiple solutions to solve the problem .\n",
      "S These solutions may be generated by analyzing existing products to find out how the weaknesses can be improved while retaining the strength .\n",
      "S We must also value-add the product to make it even more attractive .\n",
      "S On top of that , engineers can also obtain a variety of similar products and analyze them together .\n",
      "S Constantly combining ideas will result in better solutions being formulated .\n",
      "S Fourth , engineers have to analyze all the solutions which they have generated and apply professional knowledge to decide on a solution .\n",
      "S Engineers will have to use their technical knowledge to analyze the feasibility of the solutions .\n",
      "S They will then analyze the solutions in the economic and social aspects .\n",
      "S These products have to be sold in the market hence consumers must be convinced that these environmentally friendly products are as good as the present equipment in terms of performance and cost .\n",
      "S Therefore careful analysis of the product has to be made before selecting a solution for testing and implementation .\n",
      "S Last of all , engineers have to test and implement the solution which was selected in the previous step .\n",
      "S According Khandani 's article , engineers can test the solution by prototyping or concurrent engineering .\n",
      "S Prototyping involves constructing the prototype and testing it under real conditions .\n",
      "S Full scale production will not take place until extensive testing has been done .\n",
      "S Concurrent engineering requires a prototype to be constructed and the design is fine-tuned along the process .\n",
      "S However this tedious process is made easy through modern computer-aided design , analysis , and manufacturing software .\n",
      "S These computer simulations take significantly shorter time hence it is a preferred choice as it means that the product can be sold in the market in a shorter period of time .\n",
      "S Through the five designing steps , a process can be designed to meet the need to decrease carbon dioxide level .\n",

      "S Everywhere in the world , fuel is used extensively .\n",
      "S From large scale power generators to the basic cooking at our homes , fuel is essential for all of these to happen and work .\n",
      "S Research had shown that fuel consumption had increased twenty percent over the last decade , and had projected that the depletion of fuels is drawing .\n",
      "S In addition , burning of fuels emit various harmful gases pollute our fragile environment .\n",
      "S These green house gases are the main cause to worldwide global warming which give rise to further catastrophes such as the rise in global temperature etc .\n",
      "S Engineers around the world had already started on working on this problem .\n",
      "S To guide them in this heavy responsibility of saving the earth , they use a set of simple steps which guide them in engineering a remedy , known as the Engineering Design Process .\n",
      "S This process consists of five major steps , mainly defining the problem , researching on information pertaining to the problem , brainstorming of ideas , filtering of the ideas , and lastly implementing it .\n",
      "S Firstly , we can define this worldwide problem as the search of alternative resources to the existing near-depletion fuels .\n",
      "S Since fuels are non renewable and emit so much harmful gases , the alternatives that we are looking for should be a renewable one and not emit harmful pollutants .\n",
      "S Next , we have to gather relevant information about the problem so that we are able to ensure that the solution we are looking for is able to solve the problem directly .\n",
      "S Studies had shown that an average of 2 lbs ( pounds ) of fuel is needed to produce 1kilowatt of power .\n",
      "S In addition , we realized that burning of fuels produce the large amount of greenhouse gases .\n",
      "S Thus , the alternative resources we are searching for must be able to produce this large amount of energy to replace fuels , as well as not emitting that huge amount of harmful gases .\n",
      "S After identifying the important factors , engineers proceed on their search for solutions .\n",
      "S They will generate and brainstorm innovative ideas .\n",
      "S Alternatives such as the use of water energy and wind energy are some examples .\n",
      "S With these ideas , we have to analyse and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of them .\n",
      "S An example is water which is a good renewable resource and is plentiful .\n",
      "S However , water energy can only be a small option due to the feasibility .\n",
      "S This is because a large body of water is needed to harness the same energy produced by a small amount of fuel .\n",
      "S All the solutions will be thoroughly analysed by the engineers before coming to a conclusion .\n",
      "S Lastly , the engineers will put their solution to test and ensure that the solution is able to solve the problem .\n",
      "S As such , engineers made use wind turbines and water hydraulic generators to harness the wind and water energy respectively .\n",
      "S It may not be the best option but both sources are renewable and are able to be used to slow down the depleting resource - fuel .\n",
      "S This had shown that the engineering design process is essential in solving problems and it ensures that the problem is thoroughly looked into and ensure that the engineers are generating ideas that target the main problem , the depletion and harmful fuel .\n",
      "S China 's problems hampering engineering design processes for innovations\n",
      "S Since the reform and open policy in 1970 's , China has been eagerly speeding up on its way to industrialization and flourish .\n",
      "S Although the improvement is apparent , there are still a number of problems hampering engineering design processes for innovations .\n",
      "S Among them , education system and perception of innovation stand out becoming two major difficulties .\n",
      "S As Dr. Ronald B. Standler pointed out in 1998 , creativity is very important in science and engineering .\n",
      "S Drs Wayne Hall and Paul Robinson from University of Plymouth also found out that \" Engineering + Creativity = Employability for Graduates \" .\n",
      "S However , China 's examination-oriented education system deeply throttles students ' creativity .\n",
      "S Not only parents and teachers but also whole society pushes students concentrating on how to get outstanding marks in examinations .\n",
      "S Students spend most of their time reciting details in text books and doing tedious exercises again and again for the simple reason that these can help them get familiar with examinations .\n",
      "S As a result , students have no chance to develop their creative thinking and gradually become stereotype .\n",
      "S Many years ago , the situation is different .\n",
      "S In 1931 , Qian Weichang entered Tsing Hua University , major in history with 0 marks in mathematics and physics .\n",
      "S However , after one year study , he found history not suitable for himself and became interested in physics and showed great talent .\n",
      "S When he appealed to change his major , the professor saw his creativity and eagerness , so he approved the appeal .\n",
      "S After several years researching and studying , Qian Weichang made many great breakthroughs in physics .\n",
      "S However , this kind of story can never be found in modern days .\n",
      "S Recently , a student got a very good result in the National College Entrance Examination ( NCEE ) , but he did not enter the university which he applied for , because the secondary school offered him ¥ 100,000 encouraging him to stay another year in secondary school for the next year 's NCEE , expecting that he could become the top 1 student in his province .\n",
      "S Creativity is developed by students ' exploring through their self-learning .\n",
      "S However , the present education system leads students to another way .\n",
      "S Therefore , the lack of creative qualified human resource seriously hampers engineering design processes for innovations in China .\n",
      "S Another big problem is that Chinese people usually do not value innovation enough .\n",
      "S In China , it will take several years for a new technology or new engineering design to be put into practice .\n",
      "S Moreover , many of the patents will never be used in production .\n",
      "S Most factories are not willing to spend money and time on innovation .\n",
      "S This problem significantly discourages engineers to make more effort to do research and design , for they will have little motivation to work hard .\n",
      "S However , in developed countries , people really appreciate innovation .\n",
      "S When a new technology comes out , usually it will be put into use within two or three months .\n",
      "S Therefore , people are well motivated to do research and design , and industry updates frequently .\n",
      "S Finally , great innovation may come .\n",
      "S 21st century will be a more competitive and challenging opportunity for China to develop .\n",
      "S Whether China can take this chance to catch up with those well-developed countries or even surpass them depends on China 's trail of solving the present problems .\n",
      "S If China can come up with effective policy to change its education system and stimulate innovation , China 's pace to flourish may become even faster .\n",

      "S Statistics show that the numbers are only continuing to grow with the existing population explosion .\n",
      "S If the former need is put forward to an engineer , he can view it as a broad topic with many possible solutions .\n",
      "S Some solutions as examples would be to design plants/fertilizers that give higher yield or working with health experts introducing new ways to control population growth .\n",
      "S An engineer would firstly need to define the problem .\n",
      "S Defining it would include a refining of the question at hand to a more straight forward one .\n",
      "S With the current issue being a hungry population to be fed , the definition for this would be that the food production needs to meet the requirements of the people .\n",
      "S The next step towards achieving this goal would be to gather information on certain aspects relating to his \" pictured \" solution .\n",
      "S For example , if his idea is to produce plants which give much greater yield , he needs to assess the yield of existing plants .\n",
      "S From that point onwards he could design different possible approaches to what he expects to do .\n",
      "S He could genetically modify the plants genome to match with a plant that gives greater product or he could create a new genetic material for a higher yielding food plant .\n",
      "S Looking at this third step we realize why the second stage of an engineering design process of gathering information is important.Once all the information is put together into the different possible solutions , the engineer is put to decide which method out of the lot is suited best for the purpose and if agrees with existing international laws .\n",
      "S At this point also any available detail into the viability of the method is valuable .\n",
      "S Lastly comes the most crucial part of an engineering design process .\n",
      "S This determines how accurate the engineer might have been in his work and also if he looked at nature as a considerable factor during his designing process .\n",
      "S The testing stage is usually either the most rewarding or heart- breaking stage of a design process .\n",
      "S Even though the solution seems perfect according to calculations , there are \" nature factors \" that we can not control which still affect any process we carry under the sun .\n",
      "S It is likely that this genetically modified plant was give three hundred percent yield is actually not surviving until harvest .\n",
      "S If that is the case , what the engineer would do is analyze the problem at hand and point out exactly which part of the solution needs to be modified .\n",
      "S Another aspect of great engineers is their ability to optimize processes .\n",
      "S This includes less useless waste , more recyclable waste material and high productivity .\n",
      "S So any engineering process can be continuously modified into a faster , better and greener one .\n",
      "S It is self-explanatory that every engineering design process is naturally a cyclic process .\n",
      "S There is no definite correct solution for the question at hand .\n",
      "S With the many possible solutions , what a smart engineer does he figures the best solution and introduces the best way of executing it , so that the need is fulfilled immediately and effectively .\n",
      "S The process of developing a new product based on innovation is not an easy task for the innovators .\n",
      "S The innovators , who are normally work under Research and Development department , have to recognize the needs from the public or through research , are require to spend countless days and nights to understand the problems , to produce solutions to the problems , to convert the solutions into practical products and to commercialize them .\n",
      "S By diffusion and adoption of the innovation products by the public or specific users , the innovators have to face the consequences .\n",
      "S These are not the only challenges that the innovators are going to deal with .\n",
      "S In order to process from the initial stage of innovation development to the final stage , the most important issue is to have a huge sum of fund for development and commercial purposes .\n",
      "S So , the manufacture company , for example , the company that the innovators are working for , is one of the major investors that is providing the fund .\n",
      "S Innovators required development fund in order to obtain their needs , such as hardware equipments , to work on their prototypes .\n",
      "S But at times , there are some critical situations that happen or affect to the manufacturing company , the innovators somehow get to be involve too .\n",
      "S For example , if the manufacturing company did not earn profit in the market , then in order to reduce the cost and prevent the loss from getting worse , the manufacturing company has to stop funding the innovators for their prototypes development .\n",
      "S Then the innovators have to stop all works for the development .\n",
      "S For another example , during this recent economic downturn , most of the major manufacturing companies are slowing down in manufacturing productions and releasing of new products .\n",
      "S This shows that the manufacturing companies are trying to reduce the unnecessary burden to maintain the companies ' stand .\n",
      "S Therefore , this is one of the major factors that will definitely affect the innovators from developing innovation products .\n",
      "S Another challenge that the innovators need to be concern about is commercializing the finalize products .\n",
      "S In this final stage , it is all about how packaging , marketing and distribution of the products .\n",
      "S There are cases that marketing department do not wish to market the innovated products due to various reasons .\n",
      "S For example , the marketing department thinks that the innovated products are not relevant to what the company is selling .\n",
      "S Therefore , the innovated products are unable to meet the consumers .\n",
      "S Another example is the marketing department has set the price of the innovated product too high ; therefore , they fail to obtain the sales target for the selling the innovated product .\n",
      "S So , this is another major factor that the innovators have to face .\n",
      "S In brief , innovators have to face many challenges when they want to develop the products .\n",
      "S They have to obtain fund from the investors in order to develop their innovation prototypes and require help from the marketing department to have their innovation products for sales in the marketplace .\n",
      "S However , these procedures might become another challenges for the innovators .\n",
      "S Title : Obstacles for engineering design in China\n",
      "S Engineering design is defined as a process that brings ideas or theories into physical representations which satisfies human needs .\n",
      "S In an engineering design , there are usually five steps : define problems , gather related information , generate various solutions , analyze and select a solution and test and modify the solution .\n",
      "S Because Engineering designs are always related to real problem , during the five processes , the obstacles they face are more than theories and calculations on paper .\n",
      "S The obstacles for engineering designs may differ from nation to nation .\n",
      "S In my home country , China , the two most representative problems are political issues and financial issues .\n",
      "S Political issues usually become realized in the beginning and final steps , especially in the last step .\n",
      "S In the beginning step , we have to define the problem in a clear and unambiguous way .\n",
      "S Besides , a clear recognition of the real need is also important .\n",
      "S However , in some cities of China , the government wants to minimize the time spending on problem solving process to show their ability in handling problems and force the engineers to skip the first step or just accept the information the government provides .\n",
      "S And in the end such a design may turn to be useless as it does not meet people 's demand .\n",
      "S In the last step of design , political issues also disturb the process significantly .\n",
      "S For example , in my hometown Harbin , the government decided to develop an underground traffic system .\n",
      "S This design was welcomed by most of the citizens and the whole design process was carefully carried out .\n",
      "S However , when the design had been carried out for a few weeks , it was stopped .\n",
      "S The government 's explanation was because of safety consideration for earthquakes and some other disasters .\n",
      "S But such explanation was of non-sense as the engineers did not see such possibility during their designing ; otherwise the design would not be carried out at all .\n",
      "S Some evidences showed that the reason of halt of work was that the higher level of authorities thought an underground traffic system was not necessary for Harbin .\n",
      "S In this example , there is nothing wrong with the original design work , but the design still can not be carried out due to political inconsistent between the city government and higher level authorities .\n",
      "S The similarities of political obstacles in both two steps are that such problems can not be easily solved by the engineering group , in other words , the political problems are unavoidable to some degree .\n",
      "S Another problem , financial issue , is quite common during design process .\n",
      "S It affects the analyzing and test step most seriously though it can affect almost every step of design work .\n",
      "S For most design work , the engineers are always employed by some organizations or companies .\n",
      "S Without financial support , the collection of relative information and research of the various solutions have to be done in a simpler manner , and may lead to the final failure of a design project .\n",
      "S During these two steps , different solutions should be carried out in a smaller scale to examine their characteristics and to test their performance in order to make a decision .\n",
      "S If not enough fund is provided , the experiment may not be as precise as it should be to minimize the cost .\n",
      "S Such simplification may lead to an incorrect choice .\n",
      "S Besides , the lack of financial support or sudden stop in the financial support may even lead to the incomplete of a project .\n",
      "S For instance , there is one half-built bridge near my home .\n",
      "S It was hamstrung by lack of funds .\n",
      "S Compared to the political issues , the financial problem affects more steps and more common around the world .\n",
      "S But engineers still can do little to avoid such problems\n",
      "S In conclusion , the two most significant problems that hamper the engineering design process are political and financial problems .\n",
      "S Both of these two problems , though affecting different processes , can lead to a completely failure of a project .\n",
      "S Therefore , governments and authorities should pay more attention to these problems in order to get better design work for the country .\n",
      "S Legend has it that the world is created by God .\n",
      "S This may be true ; however , God did n't give us a perfect world .\n",
      "S Humankind always has needs and demands because people want to lead more comfortable and easier life .\n",
      "S So , they try to invent things which could help them achieve their goals .\n",
      "S Therefore , in modern society , engineering has become more important ; the role of an engineer is to design a safe and efficient product or a system that minimizes the damages to the environment or brings benefits to the human kind .\n",
      "S There are various fields which engineering plays an important role in our daily lives , such as entertainment , healthcare , transportation , real estate , and so on .\n",
      "S As what Khandani ( 2005 ) said , a company 's survival depends on whether its products are in high demand by the society or not .\n",
      "S Most companies are more interested to invent entertainment electronic goods such as flat LCD screens , smaller and smaller mp3/mp4 players , touch screen hand phones , more portable laptops , and so on which are most demanded in the market .\n",
      "S Though these products are highly sought-after and trendy , they are not the most essential things to people unlike healthcare products .\n",
      "S For example , a person can lead his life peacefully without a laptop or hand phone , but , can a person survive happily with the absence of good health ?\n",
      "S The answer should be 'No ' as health is the first priority in a person 's life .\n",
      "S If a person is feeling unwell , he will have no mood to enjoy any other facilities and products .\n",
      "S Thus , one current human need that should be given priority is nothing else than healthcare products .\n",
      "S Among quite a number of healthcare products available in market , prosthetic limbs play one the most important roles .\n",
      "S Prosthetic limbs are artificial legs or arms which replace the missing parts of the body .\n",
      "S They are needed for various reasons , including congenital defects , accidents or because of some diseases .\n",
      "S Losing a body part can make a person 's life miserable .\n",
      "S They may lose not only mobility but also self-confidence .\n",
      "S In this case , prosthetics limbs can help those disabled people to regain their mobility and confidence .\n",
      "S So , designing the prosthetic limbs should be encouraged as it can really change a person 's life .\n",
      "S According to Khandani ( 2005 ) ,to design an efficient and safe artificial limb may usually need five basic design processes which are defining the problem , gathering pertinent information , generating possible solutions , analyzing and selecting the best possible solution and finally testing and implementing it .\n",
      "S When defining the problem , the cost , safety and liability , comfort , ergonomic and simplicity must be taken into account .\n",
      "S For example , most of the disabled can not afford to spend a lot of money on those prosthetic limbs or some of them have an allergy to the materials used in the product .\n",
      "S Before considering the possible solutions , we need to collect all the information that relates to the problem so that we can avoid redefinition and wasting time .\n",
      "S After we confirm that the problem is real and a new solution is needed , we then proceed to step 3 in which we have to brainstorm the multiple solutions .\n",
      "S In this step , we can do it in two ways : to improve the existing idea by finding out the weaknesses or to come up with a totally new and creative idea by researching and testing .\n",
      "S Once we have alternative solutions to the design problem , we can analyze them and decide which one should be the most suitable for the needs .\n",
      "S Finally , we can implement and test the design we have chosen and if we find any problems , we can go back to step 4 and select another solution .\n",
      "S Well designed prosthetic legs can give a disabled person a new taste of life .\n",
      "S According to the article about an amputee sprinter , Oscar Pistorius , who does not have both legs but wants to take part in 2008 Olympics with his J-shaped blades ( artificial legs ) made of carbon fibers , confidently said that \" there is nothing he can not do that able-bodied athletes can do .\n",
      "S \" This is the proof that how a successful design can be beneficial to a needy person .\n",
      "S To sum up , apart from the prosthetic legs , there are still many other areas in healthcare industry that need to be improved such as artificial kidney , artificial hearts , pacemakers , medical imaging and diagnosis devices which are very advantageous to humankind .\n",
      "S Government should also more encouraging the research and development of these products .\n",
      "S With the systematic design processing , there will be more upcoming amazing healthcare products in the future .\n",
      "S In present days , engineers need to be creative and innovative in order to come up with new products .\n",
      "S However , there are many problems that will hinder the engineering design process .\n",
      "S We will focus our attention on the component decision process which will determine the type of raw materials to be used and the safety of the end product .\n",
      "S The cost of raw materials has risen significantly from the year 2003 to year 2009 and it has affected the electronics supply chain .\n",
      "S We will look at two very important components in the manufacture of electronic components , gold and copper .\n",
      "S The price of gold has risen from about US $ 380/troy ounce in June 2003 to about US $ 960/troy ounce in June 2009 ( \" Trend \" ) .1 Gold is a very important component in electrical conductivity and thus often used in contact points such as the communicating interface between the graphics card and the motherboard .\n",
      "S Hence designs that need large amount of gold may not be feasible .\n",
      "S Another component is copper .\n",
      "S Copper has good electrical conductivity which allows the conductor channel lengths and widths to be significantly reduced .\n",
      "S This results in faster operating speed and greater circuit integration .\n",
      "S However , the price of copper has risen from about US $ 1900/tonne in June 2003 to about US $ 6200/tonne in June 2009 ( \" Trend \" ) .1\n",
      "S When engineers turn to other types of cheaper materials , some functions and accuracy of the end product may be sacrificed .\n",
      "S However , if the engineers were to stick to their original design , the cost of the end product will be high .\n",
      "S The high cost of the product may deter possible customers and in the end , the profit of the company will drop .\n",
      "S Next we will look at product safety .\n",
      "S The main idea of safety in a product is to ensure that the utilization of the product does not cause any injury or death to the user .\n",
      "S One example would be the grounding of electronic devices .\n",
      "S When electronic devices are not grounded properly , there is a probability that the user might get an electric shock when he/she accidentally come into contact with the device .\n",
      "S If the current is very strong , there is even a chance that the user may die .\n",
      "S Another example would be the cases of Apple 's iPhone .\n",
      "S There are many reports around the internet and on newspaper stating that some users ' iPhone exploded and the main cause is due to the overheating of the lithium- ion battery .\n",
      "S Lithium-ion battery has a temperature tolerance of about 60OC and anything above that will make the battery unsafe for use and in the worst case scenario ; the battery explodes , causing injury or death to the user .\n",
      "S Hazardous product can tarnish the reputation of the company and sometimes even result in the loss of innocent lives .\n",
      "S Thus it is very important for engineers to do repeated trial test of the product to ensure that it is free of faults .\n",
      "S From the points above , we can see that due to the increasing price of raw materials , it is very difficult to come up with new products consistently as it is very costly to build them .\n",
      "S High selling price of the product will often deter potential customers and hence result in a fall of profit .\n",
      "S Lastly , engineers must ensure that the product must be safe to use or it will end up not only spoiling the reputation of the company , it may even injure or kill someone .\n",
      "S 1 \" Trends in the Costs of Raw Materials .\n",
      "S \" 2003-2009\n",
      "S .\n",
      "S Engineering design process can be defined as a process fused by fellow engineers in the aid of developing either an entirely new system or improvising on the current on to cater to desired deeds .\n",
      "S This process has always been seen indispensable as part of the country 's economical growth in the manufacturing sector .\n",
      "S However , the results of the recent National Innovation System ( NIS ) survey show that Singapore has a long way to go in its development of an innovation-based economy , especially in comparison to the other OECD countries .\n",
      "S As we understand the relevance and importance of engineering design , we will come to realize that in reality there are several factors that preventing the progress of engineering design .\n",
      "S Firstly , engineering design process has come to incur excessive costs .\n",
      "S Due to high global demand in the world 's limited natural raw materials , the prices of copper and silicon have rocketed sky high .\n",
      "S Engineering processes for innovations such as the wafer fabrication and semi-conductor industries are directly affected by the prices of the raw materials .\n",
      "S As a result , research and development in these fields have become way costlier compared to previous years .\n",
      "S In Singapore , there is only a certain fixed amount in the country 's national budget allocated of the research and development sector .\n",
      "S It is more expensive to conduct creative engineering research ; therefore it is inevitable that a slight reluctance in contributing more assets to engineering design by the government ; the reality of the support given by the government is weak .\n",
      "S Moreover , the government has also other financial plans in spending their resources .\n",
      "S Some feel that in these tough economical times , it is wiser to splurge the money on restructuring the economy or providing more incentives to instill entrepreneurship , rather than investing in research in engineering design .\n",
      "S Hence , the area of innovative research and development in engineering is not driven in full swing .\n",
      "S Secondly , the amount of creative people in Singapore is small , which may be a major reason for the hampering of innovative engineering design .\n",
      "S The population of Singapore is scarce compared to other countries in the region .\n",
      "S In countries like China and India , their population amount to billions whereas the population of Singapore is only 4.5 million .\n",
      "S The fact that Singapore has limited human resource limits the number of creative people in the country .\n",
      "S For example , five percent of the population in Singapore is 1000 times lesser than five percent of the population in the China .\n",
      "S As a result , the number of creative Singaporeans would be much lower relative to other countries .\n",
      "S Although there are many Singaporean-based driven engineering design projects like NEWater plants , much of our economical success due to engineering design is highly dependent on other countries .\n",
      "S For example , most of our latest mass spectrometry equipment used in the area of engineering design is largely obtained from Germany .\n",
      "S In areas of mechanical engineering , our latest machineries are either bought or are replicas from the models in Japan .\n",
      "S The impact on having a limited amount of creative people has resulted in Singapore having to resort to buying foreign-based engineering design equipment from overseas .\n",
      "S In conclusion , even though we realize the importance of engineering design processes in innovation , there are still problems like rising costs and population scarcity problem that hinders the progress of the engineering process .\n",
      "S Serendipity is usually defined as a discovery under an accidental case , and it often results the invention of a new technology .\n",
      "S One typical example is the invention of \" post-it \" notes .\n",
      "S Serendipity-based technology has some similarities and differences with technology developed through research , for example : the technology of refrigerator .\n",
      "S Firstly , both serendipity-based technology and technology developed via research are initiated by the realization of problems and needs .\n",
      "S When people encounter problems or have demands on certain things , usually they will try to solve the problems through research and development .\n",
      "S The invention of refrigerator was around 1910s as before that , people had faced the problem of food storage in summer when there was no icehouse could be used .\n",
      "S Research and development had been done to solve this problem and eventually boosted the invention of refrigerator .\n",
      "S This is how most conventional technologies been invented .\n",
      "S Similarly , bearing the problems and needs in mind , when unexpected experiment or research results come up to the researchers or scientists , accidentally they would just apply these to solve some other problems totally unrelated .\n",
      "S Post-it note was invented in this way according to Rogers .\n",
      "S 3M , famous Scotch tape company , discovered an unsuccessful bonding agent that could not stick paper tightly hundreds years ago .\n",
      "S However , the 3M researchers found out this failed bonding agent was suitable for attaching notes which satisfy many people 's needs .\n",
      "S Thus post-it note was invented from this idea .\n",
      "S In this manner , many other serendipitous technologies have been discovered and solved many irrelevant problems .\n",
      "S Thus , it is fair to say that either conventional technology or serendipitous technology is stimulated by the realization of problems and needs .\n",
      "S Also , another similarity between conventional technology and serendipitous technology is the process of development and commercialization .\n",
      "S After discovering the creative inventions from either research or serendipity , the more important step is the integration of the inventions .\n",
      "S Under this process , the attractiveness and practicality of the inventions will be improved such that they could be converted into useful products which accepted by most people .\n",
      "S If the refrigerator was remained as it was invented in 1910s and no further development has been made to improve its quality , the refrigerator would just be an unsuccessful invention due to its low efficiency and high cost .\n",
      "S After converting the new technology into useful products , it comes to the process of marketing .\n",
      "S How other people get to know your products and been convinced to use them .\n",
      "S Like what 3M researcher did , they sent their post-it products to Fortune 500 Company 's president and secretary to publicize their products .\n",
      "S Finally 3M achieved a huge success as its products were world-famous through Fortune 500 Company .\n",
      "S From these two examples above , it is clear that another similarity between conventional technology and serendipitous technology is the process of development and commercialization which involved a lot of hard work .\n",
      "S Besides the similarities , there are some differences between research-based technology and serendipitous technology .\n",
      "S Firstly and most significantly , for conventional technology , a process of research is required .\n",
      "S Research is usually based on certain organizations and it requires some time , funds and resources before the researchers can finally obtain the expected results .\n",
      "S For the invention of refrigerator , many companies like : General Electric , Kelvinator and Postum , did organized the research group to invent and develop refrigerator .\n",
      "S However , for serendipitous technology , research is not a necessary process .\n",
      "S Many new ideas may just generate from daily life , some mistakes made accidentally or during research for other technology .\n",
      "S For the post-it pads , its idea was just generated from the failed product when 3M researches tried to invent new bonding agent .\n",
      "S Also , serendipitous new ideas can be generated by anyone .\n",
      "S The only challenge is whether or not they can grab the opportunity and do further development to make the ideas into useful technologies .\n",
      "S Yet for conventional technology , it is limited to people with professional knowledge , like : researchers or scientists .\n",
      "S In conclusion , although serendipitous technology seems easier than research-based technology for research process , it still requires a lot of hard work to further develop it and one should acquire the essential knowledge before he know how the unexpected discoveries can been used to solve the problems we faced .\n",
      "S Thus , a serendipitous technology can be seen as a conventional technology with less research .\n",
      "S The Social Barrier for Innovation\n",
      "S With the rapid development of modern society , engineering innovation is of increasingly great importance to the global community and human beings .\n",
      "S In different parts of the world , however , there are various factors which slow down the process of industrial designing , and China , my home country , can not make an exception .\n",
      "S Compared to technical reasons , social reasons are the main obstacles for inventions , and finance and education stand out from all these reasons .\n",
      "S Concerning financial difficulty in engineering innovation , there are two aspects .\n",
      "S First of all , the biggest problem is the whole country lacking money .\n",
      "S As most people know , China , like most of the developing countries , is not as rich as the developed countries , such as Singapore .\n",
      "S Making creations is quite a money-consuming job , so engineers in China are faced with the difficulty that there is not enough money put into innovating industries .\n",
      "S The present focus of China is the efficiency of production .\n",
      "S Thus , more resources are distributed to production instead of innovation .\n",
      "S Besides the first problem , the second one related to finance is that the average income of common Chinese people is relatively low .\n",
      "S An industrial invention needs users immediately after it is created by engineers or it may soon fall out of the market and then eliminated by the society .\n",
      "S Chinese engineers are not short of fantastic innovating ideas but market .\n",
      "S The electrical and the gas cars have been applied for some time .\n",
      "S Over 10 years ago , some states in the U.S. decided that 10 % of the total number of cars must be environmentally friendly , that is to say , cars running on electricity or gas .\n",
      "S ( Rogers , 2003 ) Up to now , in China , only some public buses in Beijing run on gas whose fuel is supported by the government .\n",
      "S This comparison does not mean that Chinese people are ignoring the environment but most of us can not afford an electrical or a gas car which is far more expensive than a common one using gasoline as fuel .\n",
      "S Very similar to the non- polluting cars , China also has lots of creative engineering innovations , but due to higher cost than old products of the same kind , they can not be accepted by the market .\n",
      "S This problem greatly slows down the pace of creation and invention in China .\n",
      "S Apart from finance , education is another factor that can not be ignored .\n",
      "S The Chinese education has a history of over 2000 years .\n",
      "S Through the thousands of years , most Chinese scholars are greatly affected by the Confucianism .\n",
      "S One of the core theories is to teach people to obey the rules and regulations .\n",
      "S Innovation , to some degree , is like breaking the old rules and regulations and creating something new .\n",
      "S This is , in fact , not encouraged by the traditional idea of Chinese people .\n",
      "S As a result , people with Chinese educational background tend to apply the old inventions better than create new ones by themselves .\n",
      "S It is very complicated to find out reasons hindering innovation in China while finance and education do have some effect on it .\n",
      "S Despite the obstacles mentioned above , China is now moving its focus to build an innovation-encouraged society .\n",
      "S I believe these problems obstructing engineering innovation will be solved in the near future .\n",

      "S The creation of the Macintosh was the collaborated effort of fifty computer designers who worked day and night under an abusive and aggressive leadership ( Roger , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S On the other hand , under the conventional system , innovators are supposed to abide to strict workplace safety , guidelines and routine organizational procedures .\n",
      "S They work under conducive environment to accomplish their tasks .\n",
      "S To conclude , both skunkworks and conventionally generated technologies are undertaken by a group of professionals who are given adequate funds and resources .\n",
      "S However , they receive different forms of treatments and work under different environments .\n",
      "S This is to meet the society 's expectation for them to come out with inventions which are correct the first time round .\n",

      "S From past to present , many important innovations have surfaced .\n",
      "S Some of these innovations were shaped by technology while others were created from the needs and desires of society .\n",
      "S A crucial invention which has eased man 's ways of living is the aircraft .\n",
      "S According to ( AVIATION , 2009 ) \" Centuries of dreaming preceded the first successful flight \" which suggests that the basis of this innovation was from man 's dream to fly like birds they see in the sky .\n",
      "S Hence aircrafts were a socially determined technology which has developed over time , catering to the needs of humanity .\n",
      "S Firstly , military aspects were crucial in shaping the aircraft .\n",
      "S Planes of present versus those in the past show a noticeable improvement in agility and speed .\n",
      "S In World War I ( WWI ) for example , planes were fairy slower and more bulky , as mentioned by ( AVIATION , 2009 ) \" Huge biplane bombers with two , three , or four engines were introduced in World War I \" .\n",
      "S However , the military learnt from the fighting techniques used in combats during WWI and required aircrafts able to negotiate tighter turns and break the speed of sound so as to evade enemies or catch up with them .\n",
      "S World War Two showed improvements in the design and ability of aircrafts , making them smaller and therefore swifter .\n",
      "S Adding on , fighters of today are even more advanced and able to break the sound barrier .\n",
      "S Take for example the \" F-15 Eagle , which excels at air-to-air defence tactics and has a maximum speed of over Mach 2.5 \" or \" the F-16 Falcon , a highly maneuverable all-purpose fighter-bomber \" ( AIRPLANE , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S These planes are not only a mark of development in speed but also in agility .\n",
      "S Most importantly , we see that these needs of the military were a driving force behind the development and enhancement of the aircraft .\n",
      "S Secondly , social factors guided the growth of planes .\n",
      "S The globalised style of living which translates to the need to transport increasingly large numbers of passengers , and the need for fast delivery of goods or letters were some of the social issues that shaped the airplanes .\n",
      "S It is noticeable that the size of commercial planes increased over the years in the response to meet the rise in global travelers .\n",
      "S In the 1930 's , a DC-3 \" carried 21 passengers \" ( Commercial Aviation ) , while in the late 1950 's , the \" DC-8 could carry 258 passengers \" ( Commercial Aviation ) .\n",
      "S If we look at Airbus ' A380 in our world today , it carries up to \" 525 \" passengers ( A380 Family , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S A logical rationale for the creation of such a large capacity airplane would be the increased demand in air travel due to globalisation .\n",
      "S Moreover , the U.S. Post Office Department set the base for domestic airlines between 1918 and 1927 as mentioned by ( AIRPLANE , 2009 ; Commercial Aviation ) .\n",
      "S Likewise , in today 's world , global air freight agencies such as \" DHL \" or \" Fedex \" require planes able to travel long distances fast in order to ensure that mails or packages are delivered to end users in the shortest time possible .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is evident that globalisation and the need to send parcels swiftly to customers have in a way shaped aircrafts .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the aircraft , a socially determined technology , has developed from its ancient clumsy and slow predecessors to their new age , swift and agile successors .\n",
      "S These modifications were indeed not possible if not for the varying social as well as military requirements during different eras .\n",

      "S When there is a need for something , a technology is create to solve the problem .\n",
      "S The same applies for an eco-friendly car .\n",
      "S There are many factors that contribute to the creation of the eco-friendly car .\n",
      "S The factors are - political , economical , technological , environmental and social .\n",
      "S In 2006 , a documentary film , An Inconvenient Truth , written by former United States Vice President Al Gore , has sparked a series of heated discussions after it was being screened in cinemas .\n",
      "S It sent a message to the world about the drastic environmental changes due to decades of environmental abuse by mankind and what will happen if we choose to ignore this issue .\n",
      "S Subsequent actions were taken by the American government to administer a regulation that car companies could only sell ninety percent of cars with normal machinations while the other ten percent had to be eco friendly cars .\n",
      "S This implies that automobile companies had to pull in large sums of money for research and development work to create and promote the sales of such cars .\n",
      "S Without pressure from the government , no automobile company would have taken the initiative to manufacture and market out these vehicles .\n",
      "S Economic factors stressed the need for eco-friendly cars .\n",
      "S However the cost to finance this project will be high as much research and development have to be done .\n",
      "S Even though it is expensive to develop eco-friendly cars as they cost around two to three times more compared to gasoline powered cars ; however this move is vital due to the slow depletion of natural resources for vehicle consumption as it leads to the increment of fuel prices .\n",
      "S In the long run , it will not be economically viable to own a gasoline powered car .\n",
      "S The servicing costs are lower for eco-friendly cars that operate on electricity as compared to gasoline powered automobile with internal combustion engines .\n",
      "S Compared to the fuel powered car , the eco-friendly car is at a losing end due to its speed , its mileage and time taken for battery charging .\n",
      "S Fuel powered cars are capable of running longer distances , do not require battery charging time and is capable of reaching maximum speeds within seconds .\n",
      "S However , eco-friendly car developers are constantly coming up with newer technologies to improve their cars hence in the near future these cars would definitely function just as well as the gasoline powered cars .\n",
      "S One of the main purposes of the creation of eco friendly cars is due to environmental factors .\n",
      "S The need to reduce pollution levels plays a very important role .\n",
      "S Since the past decade , people are getting more conscious of the damages that we have been inflicting to the Earth .\n",
      "S As mentioned , the Inconvenient Truth has shown that there is a direct link between carbon emissions and the rising temperatures of the Earth .\n",
      "S Statistics have shown that in the past century , carbon emissions have sky rocketed to ridiculously high levels and carbon emissions mainly comes from us humans when we burn fossil fuels for our own usage .\n",
      "S As carbon dioxide \" stocks up \" in the atmosphere over years , it traps the Sun 's heat , thus creating global warming which eventually leads to various climate changes .\n",
      "S Using eco- friendly cars would reduce the carbon emissions per car drastically .\n",
      "S One of the first things we can do to help conserve the environment is to switch from gasoline cars to eco-friendly cars , that is if we already a car .\n",
      "S As awareness of the effects of climate changes grows , people realize that it is their social responsibility to try to undo the environment damages to the best their ability .\n",
      "S Hence more people are seeking for greener alternatives .\n",
      "S Even British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown has urged that all cars in Britain to be green by 2020 .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the creation of eco-friendly cars are shaped by the factors mentioned above and I believe that not only this creation is one of a kind ; it is here to stay and also one of the key creations for the future generations to further develop .\n",
      "S In this rapid economic development of the 21st century , the demand for energy is increasing .\n",
      "S However , the Earth can only provide our limited energy .\n",
      "S We can not increase the amount of fossil fuel use .\n",
      "S Dwindling reserves of fossil fuels on the basis that no matter how slow this process may be , we need to look at other ways to produce energy .\n",
      "S Hence , the use of renewable energy is very important , in our planet 's future development .\n",
      "S There many alternative source of energy can be used and applied in our life , such as solar energy , light energy , wind energy , water power and so on .\n",
      "S All of these alternative sources of energy not only help reduce our dependence on non-renewable energy sources , but also these renewable energy power generation processes are friendlier environment .\n",
      "S Currently , people realise the features of environmental protection and the economical efficiency of the solar energy ; the use of solar energy is made use of more and more widespread in the ordinary life .\n",
      "S Energy from the sun 's rays is known a very environmentally friendly which is a clean form of energy .\n",
      "S In order to produce electricity or thermal energy , only the sunlight is needed .\n",
      "S There is no need to use sunlight to generate electricity with fossil fuels , or thermal energy ; only a solar collector and solar panels are needed to energy into electricity .\n",
      "S Another advantage is that it costs less than conventional power generation and heating .\n",
      "S The feature of heating energy not only can help people save a lot of money for conventional electricity .\n",
      "S In return a lower tariff will be received , but also means that no need to have to maintain the heaters .\n",
      "S However , solar energy is not in the evening , so that energy storage is an important issue to provide a continuous supply of energy .\n",
      "S In order to keep providing heating , there is an efficient method to store solar energy by using heat-of-fusion units which use chemicals to change water to a solid form .\n",
      "S This is similar to a packed bed , but the liquid absorbs the sun 's rays and then the chemicals convert the liquid to a solid so it traps the energy .\n",
      "S Then the incidental heat traps are installed to warm the floor and house .\n",
      "S A stone floor is required so that the heat can come into the window and be absorbed into the stone floor .\n",
      "S The floor is warm during the day but cools in the evening as the heat from the floor rises up and warms the house during the evening .\n",
      "S Although there is a limitation of requiring stone floor for those people whose floors are wooden , for most people research objectives , this method can gain the most efficient result .\n",
      "S Engineering Design Processes Help Solve the Problem of Energy Shortage\n",
      "S The 21st century is faced with a severe problem of global energy shortage .\n",
      "S Industries require resources such as electricity , oil and petroleum for varies outputs .\n",
      "S The rate of energy consumption by human is much higher than what nature is able to produce .\n",
      "S Therefore , the last decade has witnessed the increasing energy price due to insufficient supply of energy .\n",
      "S For example , the oil price increased from $ 15.77/bbl in 1998 to $ 91.35/bbl in 2008 ( InflationData.com ) .\n",
      "S The 479 % jump within 10 years implies that actions must be taken to solve the problem .\n",
      "S According to Khandani ( 2005 ) , engineering design activities are conducted in order to meet human needs .\n",
      "S In response to energy shortage , engineers design more efficient products and systems .\n",
      "S Among the solutions such as establishing energy-intense industry and recycling natural resources , finding alterative resources seems to be the best solution to provide sustainable supply of energy for varies industries .\n",
      "S To begin with , there are many possibilities for alternative energy resources .\n",
      "S Natural movements such as tide , wind and wave can all be used for generating power .\n",
      "S The solar technology , which converts the radiant light from the Sun into heat , can also be applied to many industries .\n",
      "S Nuclear power is more widely accepted and used as well .\n",
      "S International energy agency reports that 2.1 % of energy and 15 % of electricity are provided worldwide by nuclear power in the year 2005 ( Key World Energy Statistics , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S It shows that nuclear power may gradually replace traditional oil and petroleum .\n",
      "S Furthermore , non-traditional renewable energy such as hydrogen fuel and biodiesel are studied by engineering researchers and they may be put into practice for real industries someday in the future .\n",
      "S Although it seems very optimistic that many potential alternative energy resources can be found , there are , in fact , other economic and social constrains faced by engineers .\n",
      "S First of all , the costs of new energies , such as solar electricity are much higher , compared with traditional ones .\n",
      "S Second , alternative energy development may cause unexpected pollutions .\n",
      "S For instant , in the process of consuming hydrogen fuel , greenhouse gasses will be generated , which may contribute to global warming .\n",
      "S Third , natural energy resources such as wind energy and wave power can only be used in large countries with sufficient land and water ; thus , small countries may encounter energy dependence on outer resource and forced to pay much more for energy supply .\n",
      "S To further improve the solution of solving the problem of energy shortage by using alternative energies , it requires more efforts by engineers .\n",
      "S A more efficient way of generating renewable energy needs to be developed in order to lower the market price .\n",
      "S Zero carbon technology is encouraged in response to the concern of climate change .\n",
      "S To conclude , engineering design process can be applied to help solve the current problem of global energy shortage .\n",
      "S A variety of natural and renewable energies can be considered as alternative energy resources .\n",
      "S If engineers are capable of introducing environmental friendly energies with reasonable cost and sufficient quality , we can expect a future balance between energy consumption and energy supply .\n",

      "S Technologies are also consistently refined to meet changing needs of customers .\n",
      "S This also applies to virtual technology , which was developed under a specific social and technological background and was evolved to meet increasing needs under a changing environment .\n",
      "S Virtual technology was first developed to address needs of extensive communications .\n",
      "S By the 20th century , with the development of modern technology , communications had been made more and more convenient .\n",
      "S Such excitements brought by modern technologies had boomed the demand for more extensive interactions , not only with friends but also with strangers .\n",
      "S At the same time , new technologies had also brought privacy into people 's consideration .\n",

      "S To address such increasing social needs , the concept of a virtual world was taken into consideration .\n",
      "S Virtual technology has been designed with a series of unique properties to address the observed social needs by engaging a large user population .\n",
      "S A multi-user online environment was created , allowing a large group of people to get connected at the same time .\n",
      "S This has made interactions among a great number of users become possible .\n",
      "S The user-friendly operation platform designed has made virtual world more accepted by the public and the simplified operation process has also made virtual technology more adaptable to lay men .\n",
      "S In addition , with the establishment of facilities and the popularization of computers , virtual technology has become more and more accessible and has engaged increasing number of people .\n",
      "S The low cost of virtual technology , as compared with that of other types of communications such as telephone , has also attracted numerous users .\n",
      "S As social environment changed , the initial virtual technology developed had become insufficient to meet increased social needs .\n",
      "S Virtual technology was hence refined to meet the evolving needs .\n",
      "S Factors such as the business environment , changing educational styles and new military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions made used of virtual technology were designed to address each specific need .\n",
      "S The development of virtual technology has been largely influenced by the world 's booming economics since early 21st century .\n",
      "S New technologies had made people realize the underlying economic opportunities beyond geographic barriers and national boundaries .\n",
      "S People were looking for more convenient and cost effective methods for transactions and business cooperation .\n",
      "S Catering to this need , a series of solutions has been developed based on virtual technology .\n",
      "S One of them was E-commerce where a virtual interface was created for convenient and efficient transactions of goods and services .\n",
      "S Another example would be E-conferencing which allows a staff to attend live conferences during business trips and has made business process much more efficient .\n",
      "S Virtual technology has also been developed to meet educational needs .\n",

      "S Such business simulation games have been largely used as innovative learning tools in world 's business schools .\n",
      "S Apart from the demands from business and education , other factors have also shaped the development of virtual technology and solutions have been designed to meet the needs .\n",
      "S An example could be the virtual training used by the U.S. army where military demands have shaped the development of virtual technology .\n",

      "S The sustainable development of China 's economy largely depends on the progress of science and technology .\n",
      "S Meanwhile , the level of development of science and technology is an important symbol on behalf of a country 's strength .\n",
      "S \" Innovation \" is a popular word around the world these days , and there are myriad of facts to show the importance of scientific and technical innovation .\n",
      "S However , problems inevitably generate and affect the process of innovation due to the improper strategies or methods .\n",
      "S As far as I can concern , there are two major problems in China .\n",
      "S One is that some engineering designs do not meet the needs of market .\n",
      "S In other words , these designs are produced without adequate market survey , so they turn out to be unwelcomed among public .\n",
      "S Though the designs are products of fantastic conception , they become useless as rubbish once out of market .\n",
      "S After the policy of reform and opening-up , Chinese government has long been encouraging people to make varieties of innovations .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , it does not mean that whatever designs can be made .\n",
      "S The key is still the needs of market .\n",
      "S In addition , among all applicants of patents , individuals are the major part .\n",
      "S Individual has an obvious disadvantage compared with teamwork , and that is to say individual can not handle everything well at the same time .\n",
      "S Without market survey and access to sale or adoption of the market , it is inadvisable to make deigns blindly by divorcing oneself from reality .\n",
      "S No amount of them is meaningful .\n",
      "S The second problem to hamper engineering design process that I can concern is the patent policy .\n",
      "S China has long been a great country of patents , but the success of patents is quite rare .\n",
      "S The basic reason is many patents do not have the preconditions to commercialize themselves .\n",
      "S Most Chinese patents are \" Appearance Patent \" , not \" Innovation Patent \" .\n",
      "S Appearance patent is a rather tough issue and among patent infringement in China , more than 90 % belong to this kind .\n",
      "S What I have to point out is , appearance patent application does not need to be censored .\n",
      "S As long as the application documents meet the format , the patent will be approved .\n",
      "S The rapid application for patents causes large numbers of patent infringement cases .\n",
      "S Statistics show that , \" just in 2005 , China 's public security organs at various levels arrested more than 45 thousand suspects for IP infringement and people 's courts at various levels accepted 3567 criminal cases at the first instance .\n",
      "S \" Now the disputes of patents have been the most serious trouble for the normal development of some companies .\n",
      "S Good patents are probably killed in research stage .\n",
      "S The condition in developed countries may be different .\n",
      "S For example , in America , all patents must be censored and the cases of patent infringement are fewer than China .\n",
      "S Normally the lawsuits of patent infringement can be settled out of court due to the high cost and complicated procedures .\n",
      "S While in China , with simple procedure and low cost , lawsuits of patent infringement even become a tool to make unfair competition between companies .\n",
      "S Chinese government also pays attention to reforming the patent law and the new law will be put into practice on October .\n",
      "S In conclusion , China is sparing no efforts to solve problems in order to make innovations real intellectual product .\n",
      "S The principles are establishing a perfect patent system based on the market need .\n",

      "S Problems hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China and the effects\n",
      "S Every country will encounter problems in their development .\n",
      "S As a developing country , now China is facing problems on many fields .\n",
      "S This essay discusses two problems which significantly hamper engineering design processes of innovations in China .\n",
      "S The two problems are the situation of education and public policy on industry .\n",
      "S The problems bring some effect on engineering design from two aspect , independent innovation and engineering application .\n",
      "S First , the situation of education in China is a problem for innovation .\n",
      "S It is accepted that Chinese student are good at science .\n",
      "S They have solid foundation on math and physics , they can solve complex and difficult problems in short time .\n",
      "S However , these are just results of long-term training .\n",
      "S China 's education is typical exam-oriented education .\n",
      "S Now , this situation has become a problem for the nation that the generation at present age is lack of creativity and innovation ability .\n",
      "S In China 's education system , students are only required to receive knowledge and repeat exercising to consolidate knowledge but neglect to explore .\n",
      "S Chinese students are taught to remember many formulas and { solution approach } [ HYPERLINK : dict : //key.0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/solution % 20approach ] es rather than ask questions .\n",
      "S Under this mode of education for long time , people 's thinking is limited and rigid .\n",
      "S The president of { Chinese University of Science and Technology } [ HYPERLINK : dict : //key.0895DFE8DB67F9409DB285590D870EDD/Chinese % 20University % 20of % 20Science % 20and % 20Technology ] pointed that students ' lacking of innovation would become the bottleneck of development of China in the future CITATION You05 \\ l 2052 ( You , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Besides , there are still many inadequacies in the policy of science and industry .\n",
      "S In China , economic policy is very wide but policy on industry is strict .\n",
      "S For example , investment and concerns that the nation put on technology research and engineering are deficient ( Xin , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Engineering design is inventions-devices which need many support to gather technologies and solve problems in practice .\n",
      "S However , the policy of engineering and industry can not meet the needs .\n",
      "S The state only put investment on specialized research institutes .\n",
      "S In the actual production and application , the support from government is not nearly enough .\n",
      "S The two problems would bring some effects on engineering design and innovation for China .\n",
      "S First , under the mode of education , most engineers and scientist are relatively weak at creativity .\n",

      "S China , for decades , has been called \" world factory \" by the rest of the world .\n",
      "S Since the economic downturn spread all over the world , China has been regarded as the engine that will pull the world out of recession .\n",
      "S Although China is expected to prosper by a lot of people and countries , there are still problems that hamper its development .\n",
      "S This article will focus on two major problems that hamper innovational process of engineering in China and their impact on certain stage of the process .\n",
      "S The first problem that hampers design and innovation in China is China 's low-end industrial structure .\n",
      "S China industry is mostly at the lower end of the world production chain , which means the production in China is energy- consuming , labour-intensive , but not so profitable .\n",
      "S Although China devotes a lot of resources into production , the added value for innovation is low .\n",
      "S For example , a factory in southeast China produces toys for a Japanese company and these toys are sold to North America .\n",
      "S Out of 10 dollars made , this factory only have 1 dollar , while the Japanese company gets 9 .\n",
      "S The reason why this factory gets so little is that the design belongs to that Japanese company .\n",
      "S What this factory does is simply producing the toys .\n",
      "S In reality , there are thousands of such factories in China , which reflects the situation of China 's low-end industrial structure .\n",
      "S As a consequence of China 's low-end production which gains profit from mass production and resource consumption , China companies mainly focus on lowering cost , rather than creating innovative ideas .\n",
      "S Therefore , very little money is devoted to design process for innovation and these companies only repeat this low-end production circle .\n",
      "S In addition to China 's low-end industrial structure , the bad situation of intellectual property protection also hampers engineering innovational process .\n",
      "S In China intellectual property right is not well-protected .\n",
      "S People can find pirate version of software in most cities .\n",
      "S There are some products which directly copy the design of foreign companies .\n",
      "S Due to certain reasons , this situation is not expected to improve a lot in the near future .\n",
      "S Since the right of inventors and innovators is not well-protected , people are unwilling to create new products .\n",
      "S Therefore , innovation is discouraged by lack of protection for intellectual property in society .\n",
      "S To sum up , China 's low-end industrial structure and bad situation of intellectual property protection are the two major problems that hamper engineering design process in China .\n",
      "S Low-end production pattern makes companies focus on cutting cost , rather than making innovation , while lack of protection for innovation makes people unwilling to generate new ideas .\n",
      "S When China tries to promote engineering design process for innovations , these are the two problems China should tackle .\n",

      "S After several years ' effort , magnetic monopole was detected by the researchers from the Helmholtz- Zentrum Berlin fur Materialien und Energie have , in cooperation with colleagues from Dresden , St. Andrews , La Plata and Oxford ( Magnetic Monopoles Detected In A Real Magnet For The First Time , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Obviously , the discovery of magnetic monopole indicated a great progress in pyhsics field .\n",
      "S People may think about what led the success of the discovery of magnetic monopole .\n",
      "S Generally speaking , the development of technologies is always viewed as technologically determined or socially determined .\n",
      "S In this case , the discovery of magnetic monopole was most likely to be promoted by advanced technologies .\n",
      "S However , social determinist , which can be defined as technology is boosted by social factors , is also an important factor in the development of technologies .\n",
      "S To specify , social determinist can be further categorized into several distinguished factors , such as economic factors , military demands , and government policies .\n",
      "S Nowadays it is common to see a person carry a laptop everywhere , which was unimaginable thirty years ago .\n",
      "S While , the appearance of laptop was due to the working demands from workers in company .\n",
      "S During the old days , there was no laptop , but got only desktop that workers had to share one machine to do their mass work , which caused great inconvenience .\n",
      "S In order to solve this problem , a person called Mizoguchi in Toshiba Company came up with the idea of inventing laptop ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S With the help of engineers , he finally invented the laptop that we use every day now , and undoubtedly , his achievement made a great success in computer marketing .\n",
      "S Till now , laptop is still a necessary tool in people 's daily life .\n",
      "S One of the reasons for its success was that laptop catered to people 's needs greatly .\n",
      "S Thus , after briefly viewing the development of laptop , we can conclude that , the appearance of this marvelous invention was initially driven by the demands of people , and then its development was supported by technologies .\n",
      "S For many years , people have always been trying to come up with some technical innovations to be environmentally beneficial .\n",
      "S Naturally , electric cars were invented .\n",
      "S Instead of using gasoline , electric cars used only battery power , which no more caused air pollution and reduced the cost as well ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S However , in the consideration that electric cars could not travel far distance , and it was not convenient to get battery charged , electric cars finally lost out in the market , due to the restriction of usefulness .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , electric cars is still regarded as a great trial innovation , which still need further technology support to make improvement .\n",
      "S From the examples in the context above , we can conclude that generally , the development of technology is determined by both technological factors as well as social factors .\n",
      "S More precisely , the appearance of a new innovation is initially motivated by socially determinist , and then it needs technological support in the process of development .\n",
      "S Last but least , any technology must be well designed using advance technology skills , otherwise it will most likely to lose out in the market .\n",

      "S According to Khandani ( 2005 ) , inventions are actually accumulated on the basis of original technologies which aim to satisfy people 's needs .\n",
      "S This is undoubtedly true because that inventions throughout history have greatly improved the quality of people 's lives , and people 's endless desires have stimulated development of new technologies .\n",
      "S In the 21st century , new desires , as well as new problems have emerged , such as environment pollution , bionics , exploration of outer-space and so on .\n",
      "S Among all of these needs , the most urgent and necessary technologies should be the ones that cope with the effect of global warming .\n",
      "S Indeed , the overwhelming effects of rising temperatures and average sea-levels have threatened the survival of humans possibly in the near future .\n",
      "S In recent years , numerous hypotheses and inventions have been raised .\n",
      "S Among the possible solutions to global warming , the prior technology that should be developed is solar cars , because it could not only effectively reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , but also take advantages of natural resources .\n",
      "S Firstly , using solar cars could effectively reduce the emission of greenhouse gases , especially carbon dioxide .\n",
      "S It is stated that a significant parf of carbon dioxide emission is due to burning of fossil fuels , such as gasoline and natural gases .\n",
      "S ( What is the best possible solution to stop global warming ? , para .\n",
      "S 1 ) Thus , continuing to use large number of traditional cars would deteriorate the environment at a shocking rate .\n",
      "S In contrast , solar cars use solar energy which is clean and environmentally-friendly .\n",
      "S Moreover , solar cars take advantages of solar energy which is approachable.and cheap .\n",
      "S In this way , people no longer have to worry about the exhaust of gasoline resources .\n",
      "S Besides , using solar energy actually cost nothing , which ensures that solar cars could be affordable in the long run .\n",
      "S However , solar cars are still not popular in the market due to the high cost of production and low feasibility .\n",
      "S Thus , popularizing solar cars requires lowering the price and enlarging the capacity of solar battery .\n",
      "S Actually , it is not easy to lower the price of solar cars since currently the materials used to make solar cars are high-tech aero-materials which are quite expensive .\n",
      "S Therefore , in order to lower the cost of production of solar cars , development of new materials is crucial .\n",
      "S Besides , the current development of solar battery is not good enough to afford long-distance driving .\n",
      "S Though newly developed solar battery can support hundreds of miles , it requires a rather critical weather extremely sunny days .\n",
      "S In conclusion , replacing traditional cars by solar cars can effectively control the deterioration of global warming , but further improvements are needed to widely popularize the use of solar cars .\n",

      "S By this way , all the processes are often set up from the beginning , though sometimes mistakes were found and need adopting .\n",
      "S Many people are strongly convicted that conventional research is often more costly than serendipitous one .\n",
      "S On the contrary , in some cases the opposite applied when a unexpected observation 's financial supports was in fact much higher than those of scientific one .\n",
      "S The reason for this seemingly-contradictory surprise is that : while a scientific research , particularly the vaccine discovery has to go through the innovation- development process ; whether its counterpart does the same thing depends on the original research .\n",
      "S The total costs for an accidental one , therefore , can still be enormous .\n",
      "S For instance , the discovery of penicillin , though a big serendipitous observation , still costs as many of financial supports as the discovery of vaccine .\n",
      "S In short , it can be concluded from the comparison between penicillin and vaccine discovery that the kind of research , whether conventional or serendipity , does say nothing about the financial supports for it .\n",
      "S Last but not least , it would be mistaken without mentioning the importance of two kinds of research on our society .\n",

      "S As stated by Khandani ( 2005 ) , collecting enough information before finding solutions will reward you with great bonus .\n",
      "S Designing a new industrial system or product which works more efficient with less energy consumption is a complicated process thus needs sufficient analysis on information .\n",
      "S Only by doing this we can make it clear that what the state quo of energy consumption is and whether a proposal is applicable .\n",

      "S Bar code , being familiar as black lines with numbers , is a \" method of automatic identification and data collection \" ( Bellis , n.d. , para 1 ) .\n",
      "S The first patent of bar code was created in 1952 by Bernard Silver and Norman Joseph Woodland ( Seideman , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Through decades of development , bar code has been shaped by social factors to some extent .\n",
      "S The users , especially retailers and product manufacturers , play important roles in improving bar code .\n",
      "S Specifically , the demands of users , the economic concerns of users and the wide range of users are significant factors that shape the invention .\n",
      "S Firs and foremost , bar code emerged and developed as the times required .\n",
      "S The urgent demand of retailers to increase efficiency and accuracy in operation predicted the emergence of bar code .\n",
      "S According to Seideman ( n.d. ) , as early as in 1890 people realised their need and invented punch cards which played partial role of bar code .\n",
      "S However , the first application area of bar code was not supermarket or grocery but railroads .\n",
      "S Unfortunately , the implementation of bar code in railroad industry failed because it did not fit the industry perfectly and its functions were not completely utilized .\n",
      "S On the other hand , retailers then were just in need of a system like bar code .\n",
      "S In 1966 , a grocery industry meeting regarding implementation of bar code was held by RCA ( Seideman , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S It was then that this technology began to flourish .\n",
      "S Today the demands of users are still shaping bar code , expanding it to more application fields like libraries and post industry .\n",
      "S Another factor that affects bar code 's development is the economic concerns .\n",
      "S As bar code is designed to store information of the products , all products have to be labelled .\n",
      "S Besides , users have to buy devices that read bar code as well .\n",
      "S So economy cost became a big concern .\n",
      "S Due to this reason , bar code was not broadly implemented as soon as it was invented .\n",
      "S The concerns pushed the technology forward , and eventually came the bar code we use nowadays .\n",
      "S Having settled the economic concerns of users , bar code wins users ' heart quickly .\n",
      "S Since its first read in 1974 , bar code has been adopted for 35 years ( Shih , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S The economic factors have been shaping bar code and making it survive even facing the great competitor RFID ( Shih , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S In addition to the demands and economic concerns , the wide range of users helps to improve bar code .\n",
      "S It promotes bar code to be developed into an internationally recognized and commonly readable system .\n",
      "S It is clear that globalization is inevitable which means bar code has to adjust itself to meet globalization .\n",
      "S Apparently , a standard system is needed otherwise it will be difficult to trade .\n",
      "S Bar code has been standardised since 1970s and it is being improved accordingly ( Seideman , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Besides globalization , the various kinds of users shape it to an easily implemented technology .\n",
      "S This guarantees that most users are able to master use of devices quickly .\n",
      "S To sum up , bar code is an important technology .\n",

      "S Here , we face problems of shortage of natural resources as well as lack of funding , when it comes to designing for our innovations .\n",
      "S These could greatly affect the engineering process for designing for our innovations .\n",
      "S The shortage of natural resources mean that all raw materials required for engineering design process for innovations would have to come from import .\n",
      "S This by itself poses problems such as greater cost incurred for innovations , shipment fees , as well as a delay in engineering design process .\n",
      "S The higher cost makes it expensive for engineering designing processes hence groups that do not have funding or sufficient funding will be held back .\n",
      "S This is because the designing process usually involves a lot of trial and error , using various materials for different parts of the innovation , in order to optimize the best working condition for the item of innovation .\n",
      "S The delay in shipment of raw materials causes a lapse of time before the materials can reach Singapore .\n",

      "S Professor Seah ( 2009 ) mentioned that the Formula Society of Automotive Engineers ( FSAE ) their first formula race car took 2 years instead of 1 to be produced , partly because of a lack of raw materials and funding .\n",
      "S The long shipping time and greater cost due to importing of raw materials delayed the engineering design process as they only have a plan of the race car but no chance to physically fabricate the parts and build the car , while the raw materials are still on their way to Singapore Another problem which could greatly affect the engineering process for designing is a lack of funding .\n",
      "S The designing process requires a large amount of raw materials for repeated fabrications of each part with different material in order to obtain the most suitable material to optimize the function of the product of innovation .\n",
      "S Even for the same kind of material , it might have to be used several times as the parts fabricated is not necessarily always in the expected condition when it is first made , resulting in a wastage and hence greater consumption of raw materials and therefore a greater cost incurred in the designing process .\n",
      "S Without funding , this step of designing would be impossible especially if the raw materials are required in large quantity .\n",

      "S Toshiba laptop is largely affected by social determinists .\n",
      "S Its success is determined mainly by three factors : company 's perception towards the product , economic factor and social factor .\n",
      "S The most important factor that contributes to Toshiba 's success is changes in company 's perceptions towards the product .\n",
      "S Before the laptop was invented , the company was only selling desktop computers .\n",
      "S At that time , business of the company 's computers was poor and hence the investors were not willing to invest time and labour into the project .\n",
      "S However , the inventor , Mizoguchi , was not disheartened and worked in the dark .\n",
      "S When the first laptop was being produced , corporate executives were still against the idea of selling the new laptop .\n",
      "S Fortunately , Mizoguchi 's product caught the eyes of the senior vice president of Toshiba Europe and thus he offered to sell ten thousand laptops in a year .\n",
      "S Even though the project took an extra two months , it helped to increase market share of Toshiba .\n",
      "S This example shows that the change in perception leads to different outcome .\n",
      "S If there have been no changes in views of investors , Toshiba laptops would not have existed in the current market .\n",
      "S Besides the company 's perceptions , economic factor also play an important role .\n",
      "S Resources and funding are required in an innovation to help improve it .\n",
      "S One is not able to come out with successful innovations by dreaming of their achievements .\n",
      "S Coming out with new products requires support .\n",
      "S For Toshiba , the profits earned from the sales of the laptops were further invested to improve the quality of the later-produced laptops .\n",
      "S If a product has no financial support , it will not be successful as it not able to keep up with the challenges of the newly developed technology .\n",
      "S The most important factor that contributes to any innovation is the response of the public .\n",
      "S Consumers are important groups of people who will determine the success of the product .\n",
      "S At that time , the offices were cramped and there were no space available for workers to place their desktop .\n",
      "S The newly invented laptops were able to overcome these problems because of their small size and the ability to be carried around conveniently .\n",
      "S This convenience increases efficiency of workers as they are now able to work from anywhere in their offices besides their desk area .\n",
      "S As mentioned in the Rogers ( 2003 ) article , \" By 1988 , Toshiba commanded a 38 percent market share for laptops in Europe and 21 percent in the United States ; a year later , it commanded 46 percent market share in Japan , despite the quick reactions of its competitors .\n",
      "S \" More technology savvy people demand for laptop and thus the company constantly innovated and improved in order to bring the invention to greater heights .\n",
      "S The Toshiba laptop was successful because of economic , social and the change in the company 's perceptions of the product .\n",

      "S Two types of discoveries\n",
      "S There were a lot of discoveries in history which resulted in the various products and technologies we use today .\n",
      "S Most of these discoveries are made due to normal research .\n",
      "S But there still existed a lot of discoveries that were made as a result of serendipitous result of normal research which always had some interesting stories behind them .\n",
      "S Although these two types of discoveries could both influence the society , there are two interesting differences between them in designing process .\n",
      "S ( Rogers , 2003 )\n",
      "S The first difference is the purpose and the process of the research .\n",
      "S Usually , the normal research is due to a certain need in life and wants to make some discovery to meet the need .\n",
      "S All the process in the research is to serve the purpose .\n",
      "S In contrast , there is always no specific need for the serendipitous discovery and the research which makes the discovery is usually for other purpose , and the serendipitous discovery is usually due to unexpected result of a normal research .\n",
      "S A good example is the discovery of Post-it notes .\n",
      "S 3M Company wanted to find a kind of super glue but unexpectedly they found this kind of glue that was not strong but could be used several times .\n",
      "S But this unexpected result led to the successful product of a new kind of notes which is now well knownPost-it .\n",
      "S ( Rogers , 2003 )\n",
      "S The other difference between a normal discovery and a serendipitous one is how to find the use of the discovery in the process of commercialization .\n",
      "S For normal discovery , this is not a big problem because the discovery is for serving a specific purpose .\n",
      "S So the usage of the discovery is quite clear .\n",
      "S But for serendipitous discovery , as the discovery is unexpected nobody will know the potential use of it after the discovery is made .\n",
      "S Even there is a possibility that nobody will notice it .\n",
      "S So it is much harder to turn it into use .\n",
      "S But fortunately , we got very smart and careful people who were able to find them and find a way to use them .\n",
      "S For example , during World War I , a British scientist called Brearly wanted to invent a kind of strong material which could be made into very good guns .\n",
      "S But he only invented a kind of material which was bright luster than other materials but not strong enough .\n",
      "S He was disappointed .\n",
      "S But later he thought why not made this beautiful material into dinner set ?\n",
      "S Finally , it turned out to be a great success .\n",
      "S ( Accidental Inventions , 2008 )\n",
      "S Although there are differences between the two types of discoveries , there is also some similarities between them .\n",
      "S For example , they both are discovered in research , they have to be developed to a certain degree before commercialization , and finally they have to be turned into products and so on .\n",
      "S ( Rogers , 2003 ) In conclusion , there are two main differences between normal discovery and serendipitous discovery , one is the purpose and process of the research and the other one is the process to turn the discoveries into use .\n",
      "S Besides , there are also similarities between them .\n",
      "S Anyhow , both of them have made a great contribution to the human society and hope there will be more discoveries being made , no matter which type they are .\n",

      "S Problems to Engineering Design in Singapore\n",
      "S Living in a small country like Singapore has various limitations and thus more challenging for her to compete with larger nations .\n",
      "S Several of these limitations significantly affect the design process of new innovations .\n",
      "S A majority of these limitations would increases the cost of the innovation and hence require careful design .\n",
      "S One of these problems includes the city-state 's lack of land space which would affect the structural design of the innovation particularly if it was on the large scale .\n",
      "S Another would be Singapore 's dense population that affects the location and structural considerations of the design process .\n",
      "S Singapore currently has a land space 683 square kilometers , a country barely visible on the map .\n",
      "S A strategy adopted by the government to solve this problem is land reclamation , which currently accounts for about 10 % of its land space .\n",
      "S To further maximize land space , Singapore 's structures are mainly skyscrapers with strong and often costly foundations .\n",
      "S This issue particularly affects innovations that are on the larger scale , as large cost will be incurred in the construction of its foundations .\n",
      "S This increase in cost will hence hinder the market value and affect the economic analysis stage of the design process .\n",
      "S Take for example the housing in Singapore , which comprises mainly of Housing Development Board [ HDB ] flats .\n",
      "S In view of the collapse of Nicoll highway back in April 2004 , HDB has put up very strict requirements on the piling process and the materials used , like grade 30 concrete should be used in piling .\n",
      "S Similarly , the steel structure that forms the backbone of the buildings , require a minimum of 3mm steel gauge at least .\n",
      "S All these may drive up cost and hence affect the design process .\n",
      "S Aside from the problem of the lack of land space , there is also the consideration of its extremely dense population .\n",
      "S Contradictory to its limited land area as discussed earlier , it houses more than 4 million people .\n",
      "S During the peak hours , crowded trains and bus stations will be hard to miss .\n",
      "S New innovations thus have to consider its design rather seriously given the circumstances .\n"

      "S All these will seriously affect the functionality analysis stage of the design process , as more time and consideration will have to be channeled into this portion .\n",
      "S One example of a properly located and well-designed amenity would be the Mass Rail transit [ MRT ] stations .\n",
      "S Some stations are made connected to shopping malls while others to bus interchanges , thereby making transport in Singapore relatively convenient .\n",
      "S In addition to that , some of these stations like City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut station , not only play the role of an important hub in Singapore 's transport system , but also an internal shopping center within itself .\n",
      "S City- link , which is connected to city hall station , is an underground network of shops that link itself to other larger shopping facilities .\n",
      "S Such an example shows how proper planning of the amenities lead to the success of the application .\n",
      "S In conclusion , being a small country , Singapore has several issues that may affect the design process of future innovations , particularly its limited land space and its extremely dense population .\n",
      "S Certain examples like the MRT and the HDB flats are evidence that even with limited resources , Singapore can still flourish .\n",
      "S With proper design and careful planning , perhaps these limitations would be a thing of the past .\n",

      "S Compare and contrast about guncotton and explosive\n",
      "S In most people 's opinion technology can only developed or created via research .\n",
      "S Such as the invention of new explosive , in order to find new explosive Nobel spent nearly all his time doing experiments in his library .\n",
      "S But there are still some technology is invented from a serendipitous discovery .\n",
      "S Such as guncotton , it is invented by Schoenbein by chance .\n",
      "S Difference between these two inventions is the ideas about how to invent them come out in different ways .\n",
      "S As we all know Nobel is a very hardworking and brave man .\n",
      "S He nearly used all his time to work for new explosive and his younger brother dead in a failing experiment at the same time his brother 's death had an unbalancing affection on his father .\n",
      "S His father dead right after his younger brother ( Nils .\n",
      "S R , N.d ) .\n",
      "S But he never gave up and risked his life to go on his invention and his ideas came from his effort .\n",
      "S The story about how Schoenbein invented guncotton was quite an interesting story .\n",
      "S According to Yang ( 2007 ) , \" when Schoenbein is doing experiments he overthrew a bottle of chemical solution , and the solution flowed on the table Schoenbein found nothing but his wife 's apron to clean the table .\n",
      "S After he finished cleaning he thought that his wife will blame him after she saw what he had done .\n",
      "S So he wanted to use the stove to dry the apron .\n",
      "S When he walked near the stove the apron burned without any smoke and ashes left .\n",
      "S Then he felt very happy because he realized that he had found a new kind of explosive .\n",
      "S \" Nobel can invent the explosive successfully because of his diligence and the attitude towards science which made him never give up .\n",
      "S Schoenbein came up with his idea accidentally and finally made an great invention for the word .\n",
      "S There are also some similarities between these two technologies .\n",
      "S First of all they are both invented by prudential chemists .\n",
      "S If Noble is not a prudential person and do not do his experiments and observe the phenomenon seriously though he is hardworking he may never invent the new explosive successfully .\n",
      "S From the story of how Schoenbein came up with the idea about the guncotton we can tell that he is really a lucky scientist .\n",
      "S But without the prudential attitude towards science he may miss his good luck and did not go on finding how can this phenomenon occur .\n",
      "S Secondly these two technologies both made great contribute to the industry and military affairs .\n",
      "S As both of them are explosive , people use them to exploit mines , tear down great buildings and provide a high temperature for many chemical experiments .\n",
      "S They are also widely used in battlefield .\n",
      "S Engineer use them to make all kinds of weapons .\n",
      "S Technology no matter it was developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous was scientist 's greatest contribution to the word .\n",

      "S The 'Made in China ' phenomenon has signaled China 's endeavor to catch up with the advanced western countries .\n",
      "S However , the unprecedentedly rapid economic growth , driven by manufacturing and export industry , probably prevent people from discovering the problems that may impede engineering design process for innovation .\n",
      "S Two of these problems involve the special political environment and Chinese people 's mindset , which already have negative influence on several stages of engineering design process for innovation in China .\n",
      "S First of all , the special political environment many account for the stall of some stages of the whole process , such as the stage of recognizing a need or problem and the stage of innovation-development .\n",
      "S On one hand , many old-style leaders have long been so satisfied with the annual double-digit economic growth that they tend to refuse to seek innovative factors to boost the economy .\n",
      "S In fact , if we date back to the earliest related term in the party 's document , as it turns out , \" it is not until October 2000 and the Fifth Session of the Fifteenth Party Congress that the 'cultural industries ' were formally proposed as part of the recommendations document for the national Tenth Five-Year Plan \" ( Zhang Xiaoming , Hu Hulin and Zhang Jiangang , 2004 , as cited in Keane , 2007 , p.81 ) .\n",
      "S On the other hand , for a system so guided by the central planning , having such decision makers means that it probably will have difficulty recognizing a need or a problem .\n",
      "S Consequently , research and development ( R&D ) activities are not likely to be stimulated instantaneously .\n",
      "S Even though R&D activities are somehow initiated successfully , the nature of central planning which calls for \" information to be moved up and down the hierarchy \" ( Chan , 2009 ) may throw obstacles in the information-exchange process , which is significant to the innovation-development process .\n",
      "S Additionally , as Keane ( 2007 ) cited in his book 'Created in China ' , \" socialism overplayed the role of productive forces and failed to develop the innovative potential of human capital \" .\n",
      "S For instance , Gage ( 2006 ) showed that in a case study published by the Washington Policy Centre , a non-partisan think tank , health facilities were required to get permission from the State Health Agency to build and extend their health care facilities .\n",
      "S As it was unveiled in the research report , it somehow took longer for the health facilities to obtain approval from the State Health Agency than to actually build or extend the needed facilities .\n",
      "S In truth , the hospital would not be allowed to renovate unless it discarded ten beds ( ) .\n",
      "S As a result , the central planning actually created monopolies in this case , and the communication between manufacturing and supplier broke down due to such central planning interference .\n",
      "S Thus , the demands of consumers and the free market could not be met .\n",
      "S Another problem refers to Chinese people 's mindset .\n",
      "S As Michael Keane ( 2007 ) has noted , the common assumption existing long among the Chinese was that productivity directly equals to material production .\n",
      "S \" In other word , a focus on production and performance indicators in China had impacted negatively on innovation \" .\n",
      "S Therefore , even today in China , it is still reasonable to argue that the process for innovation may not be well understood , which means , in the respective of knowledge degree of technology transfer , the innovation-development does not seem capable to function well .\n",
      "S Moreover , according to what E. M. Rogers ( 2003 ) stated in 'The Generation of Innovation ' , in the face of high degree of uncertainty , these social factors in innovation-development process determine what technology is actually available to the consumers .\n",
      "S To sum up , we are all witnessing the state 's transformation from 'Made in China ' to 'Created in China' .\n",
      "S In current stage , political environment and people 's mindset are two of the problems that may hamper engineering design process for innovation .\n",
      "S Furthermore , these problems already have impact on several stages of the process .\n",

      "S ) , we can compare the two products in a new and fresh perspective .\n",
      "S Rogers ' first stage is needs or problems , which indicates the initial target or request of the whole research and development process .\n",
      "S It is quite interesting that the initial researching target of the two products is the same : to create a more powerful and adhesive glue .\n",
      "S However , it turns out later that the serendipitous discovery actually has no real target in this stage , because the real use of post-it note seems totally different from what it has been expected at the beginning .\n",
      "S The next stage research is to use the scientific method to fulfill the previous target .\n",
      "S So we can find that the super glue 's inventor successfully find what he needs while the post-it notes ' inventor create a strange glue that is low adhesive but re-adherable .\n",
      "S In this stage , the difference between the two kinds of discoveries turns to be that the serendipitous discovery 's inventor could not meet his initial needs like the normal inventor but accidently create a totally different product instead .\n",
      "S The third and fourth stages , development and commercialization , are to meet the needs of the consumers and try to improve the products .\n",
      "S And from the third stage onward , the post-it notes and the super glue finally share the similarity .\n",
      "S One is low adhesive but re-adherable so is used to make notes that can be attached to documents and other surfaces freely .\n",
      "S The other one is high adhesive and functions quickly so can be used to glue many materials quickly with great strength .\n",
      "S The inventors both find their usages and successfully make them more practical and considerate .\n",
      "S So it is no more surprising that the two products both become very popular among the consumers as soon as they come out .\n",
      "S So we can conclude that , the serendipitous discovery and the normal one differ only in the first two stages of Rogers ' innovation process .\n",
      "S And from the third stage onward , they seem to have no more obvious differences .\n",
      "S In the context of the innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view , also referred to as the social construction of technology ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Identify one important technology which was socially determined or shaped by a specific group of users and discuss how specific factors ( e.g. , economic factors , military demands , or government regulations/priorities ) have shaped this technological innovation .\n",
      "S What is technology ?\n",
      "S According to Roger ( 2003 ) , technology is a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause-effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome .\n",
      "S In the context of innovation-development process , the development of technologies may be viewed from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist view .\n",
      "S Technological determinism means the belief of a technology causes changes in society ( Rogers , 2003 ) , while social determinism argues that technology is constructed by social factors .\n",
      "S One important technology which was shaped by a specific group of users is electric vehicles , which had been shaped by four different factors that are technical , economic factors , social , and political changes .\n",
      "S Technical factor is one of the four elements that determine the development of electric vehicle .\n",
      "S Compared to the structure of a conventional automobile , electric vehicle has a similar structure but different components .\n",
      "S Electric vehicle has a lighter weight as most of its parts are made up of aluminium .\n",
      "S In addition , electric vehicle is safe to drive around as it is solely using electricity , while most conventional vehicles require gasoline , which is inflammable .\n",
      "S On the other hand , electric vehicle utilizes electrical energy by using batteries , so the engine is relatively clean , emission-free and quiet .\n",
      "S However , there are less charging stations and electric vehicle requires a long recharge time .\n",
      "S Therefore , it has limited usage and driving range .\n",
      "S Economically , technology for electric vehicles had not widely met the need because less promotion was held and there was a mass production of gasoline type automobiles .\n",
      "S Fewer promotions on electric vehicles were organized and auto shows were not often organized , resulting in relatively discouraging sales .\n",
      "S Furthermore , electric vehicles were not advertised in precise manners .\n",
      "S Besides , declined cost in oil in the past encouraged people to buy gasoline cars .\n",
      "S At this point , there was a mass production of gasoline cars .\n",
      "S Insurance and financing were included in purchasing these vehicles .\n",
      "S In the end , gasoline vehicles controlled the monopoly on automobiles in market .\n",
      "S From these examples , we can see that various economic factors had a great influence on electric vehicles .\n",
      "S Compared to conventional vehicles that are available now , electric vehicles are socially determined in several reasons : limited range of electric vehicles , beliefs and values of the society today .\n",
      "S Because of limited choices of electric cars , people choose conventional automobiles which offer greater variety of choices .\n",
      "S Despite several advantages , their interests towards electric cars are fading .\n",
      "S Additionally , some have negative beliefs and values towards electric cars .\n",
      "S They believe that their status may be lowered by purchasing the cars .\n",
      "S They also feel that these cars are less attractive compared to conventional cars too .\n",
      "S In addition , political factors can affect how the sales of vehicles go , which include government 's adherence to this technology .\n",
      "S People lose interests as government is not supportive .\n",
      "S Not only that government provides subsidies and incentives to users , who use gasoline cars , but also constructs and designs roads for conventional vehicles .\n",
      "S All in all , we can easily see that from these examples , many factors that specified by other group of users have led electric vehicles to a decline .\n",
      "S According to Sovacool ( 2009 ) , acceptance of a new technology depends not only on technical factors but also economic , political , and social ones .\n",
      "S These specific factors need to be analyzed to work out a better solution algorithmically and tackle the existing problems .\n",

      "S It is a widely used rat poison in the world !\n",
      "S But do you know the original usage of warfarin ?\n",
      "S At first , a certain chemical in warfarin was used to counteract the acid in the soil and to minimize soil erosion .\n",
      "S It was found in some sweet clover hay .\n",
      "S However , farmers who used these plants found that when they fed their cattle with them , they all died of hemorrhage .\n",
      "S Professor K.P .\n",
      "S Link then made a research and found coumarin inside the sweet clover hay , which resulted in puncturing cattle 's stomachs and caused internal bleeding .\n",
      "S This kind of chemicals enlightened Professor Link on applying them to killing rats .\n",
      "S Finally , the famous warfarin came into use !\n",
      "S It is a typical serendipity example , which in fact shares some common points with a conventional research .\n",
      "S The first similarity is that at the first step , they both require scientists to make every effort to get the results that scientists expected them to be .\n",
      "S Therefore , both of these kinds of inventions require scientists to have a proper method to do the experiment at first .\n",
      "S Thus we can not infer that serendipity occurs when scientists use wrong methods to achieve the result .\n",
      "S After all , their purposes before doing experiments are the same .\n",
      "S They will not work out the problem in an opposite way at the first step .\n",
      "S The second similarity that I consider is about luck .\n",
      "S As long as it is an experiment , it requires luck to some extent , regardless of whether it is serendipity or a conventional research .\n",
      "S Take Nobel 's invention of dynamics for example .\n",
      "S Without luck , he may die of the exploding of the dynamics and would not shout that excitedly \" I make it !\n",
      "S I make it !\n",
      "S \" Thus , luck is required at every successful experiment , let alone serendipity , which requires more luck to achieve another result to just meet a certain kind of people 's need coincidentally .\n",
      "S Although there are similarities existing , they differ from each other in several respects .\n",
      "S The first obvious difference is that serendipitous technologies are not invented on purpose .\n",
      "S Do you know some things about the invention of microwave ?\n",
      "S It was invented by an American engineer called Percy Spencer .\n",
      "S At first , Spencer cooperated with the British to study the microwave in military use .\n",
      "S By accident , he found that the chocolate bars in his pocket were melted when exposed to microwave .\n",
      "S This phenomenon interested him to use an egg for experiment .\n",
      "S What made him surprised was that the egg blew up !\n",
      "S Then the microwave oven came into use !\n",
      "S However , it was not invented on purpose at first !\n",
      "S Another difference is that serendipity is sometimes caused by additional observations of one research , while there is no further discovery as a \" bonus \" in a conventional research .\n",
      "S To conclude , both serendipity and a conventional research require luck and they are similar in their own first step , but the difference is that a serendipity finding is not on purpose and it is sometimes resulted from an additional discovery through a research .\n",

      "S After the war , this technology was transferred to commercial use and enabled faster and safer air travel .\n",
      "S In the context of the social construction of technology , I will discuss how various social factors have shaped this technological innovation .\n",
      "S Military priority during the World War II was an important factor in propelling the design and use of jet engine .\n",
      "S Frank Whittle , the inventor of jet propulsion , was a pilot in the Royal Air Force in the early 1920s .\n",
      "S When he first proposed the idea of turbo jet propulsion , it was met with skepticism by the Air Ministry and was denied assistance and funding from the country ( \" Biography : Sir Frank Whittle , \" n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Frank Whittle then continued to work on his engine but due to lack of funding , he made little progress .\n",
      "S Finally just a few months before the invasion of Poland by Germany and in the wake of possible threats , the Air ministry finally took Frank 's work seriously and promised funding in Frank 's research ( Younossi et al.,2003 ) .\n",
      "S As we can see , if there is no threat of war , the British Government may not provide any funding at all .\n",
      "S The jet engine will not be invented at all as people then do not see the need for plane to travel so fast .\n",
      "S The social setting of the invention also plays an interesting role in shaping the history of jet engine .\n",
      "S When Frank Whittle carried out his research for the British , a German physicist by the name of Hans Von Ohain had already successfully invented the jet engine and the first test flight was a whole two years earlier than Frank Whittle 's ( McTavish , 1993 ) .\n",
      "S However Frank 's model was more recognized than Han 's due to two reasons .\n",
      "S First , the first jet flight was unknown to the world due to military secrecy under the Nazi regime ( Crandall , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Second , the war ended with the Allies emerging victorious .\n",
      "S Therefore , Hans 's engine was not developed while the U.K continued to improve on Frank Whittle 's design , which would later be evolved to commercial uses .\n",
      "S In this case , the engine used was socially determined by the winning party of the war .\n",
      "S Two feasible engines had meet up with different fate due to the different social settings .\n",
      "S Last by not least , the increase in the trends of international tourism is the one factor that allows jet engines to be converted to civilian usage today .\n",
      "S After the war , peace returned and economy prospered due to reconstruction efforts .\n",
      "S People became more affluent and demand for foreign travel increased exponentially ( Lyth , 1975 ) .\n",
      "S Planes in use then were slow ; around 250 miles per hour , and the airlines industry needed a better alternative .\n",
      "S This was when the jet engines were developed to fit into the commercial planes we travel on today .\n",
      "S As we can see , a change in society trend can completely revolutionize the usage of a technology .\n"

      "S In my opinion , a serious plagiarism problem of Chinese institutes and the conservative consumption concept of Chinese people are two significant restrictions for the innovation of engineering design in China .\n",
      "S The plagiarism problem in both researching process and manufacturing process of engineering design is very serious in China .\n",
      "S In Chinese universities and other research organizations , plagiarism is rampant .\n",
      "S A Chinese study shows that \" 60 percent of PhD candidates admitted to plagiarism , bribery \" ( Marquand , 2006 ) .\n",

      "S Appropriate facilities , efficient technology support and proper use of food are required to increase the food production in order to solve the food shortage problem .\n",
      "S First and foremost , government should improve the facilities in the current agriculture system to satisfy the fundamental requirements .\n",

      "S Problems in the Engineering Design Processes for Innovations in China\n",
      "S Engineering design processes for innovations are very important to the industry of China .\n",
      "S However , some existing problems hamper the innovations .\n",
      "S Here , a make an example .\n",
      "S With the rapid development of the oil industry , the process and conveyance of oil is more and more advanced .\n",
      "S Just at this time , a new kind of material comes into being which is called new plastic material .\n",
      "S Compared with traditional metal conduit , plastic conduit has the advantages of lighter in weight , stronger ability to bear corrosion and smaller resistance .\n",
      "S In addition , plastic conduit saves sources , costs less and is easily fixed .\n",
      "S As a result , plastic conduit is very popular from engineers .\n",
      "S However , nowadays , there are some problems hamper the engineering design processes for innovations in China .\n",
      "S Two significant problems are about the raw material and the utilization .\n",
      "S Although the scale of the raw materials manufacture for the plastic conduit is extending and the quality of the materials is increasing , there are still some problems .\n",
      "S First , there is little variety of the raw materials and there are almost no special materials .\n",
      "S To meet the different needs of the market , many kinds of materials are needed .\n",
      "S But , China does not have enough kinds of special raw materials at present .\n",
      "S As a consequence , we need to import the materials from other countries .\n",
      "S The import increases the price of plastic conduit which people do not want .\n",
      "S Second , the qualities of the materials are not steady .\n",
      "S This is mainly due to our production system is not advanced .\n",
      "S We do not have the advanced equipment and do not use stabilizing agent and additive properly .\n",
      "S This problem is because of our short comings in the technology .\n",
      "S The last , the price of the raw materials fluctuate greatly .\n",
      "S The price of the ordinary materials are suitable and almost the same as other countries .\n",
      "S However , the special raw materials are very expensive , especially some accessories and some assistants .\n",
      "S As a result , we need to import the special materials from other countries .\n",
      "S Therefore , there are some problems about the raw materials of the plastic conduit that hamper the engineering design .\n",
      "S Plastic conduit has its own characteristics .\n",
      "S Special technique is needed , such as the technique of laying the conduit under the water and the repair skill .\n",
      "S However , the criterions about these techniques are still under constituting .\n",
      "S The study about plastic conduit is poor and there is no ripe method to construct .\n",
      "S These problems lead to a result that although there are good products , plastic conduit can not exert its special functions because the workers do not have the necessary knowledge and still follows the outdated methods .\n",
      "S As a result , the laggard utilization of the plastic conduit hampers the process of engineering design .\n",
      "S Plastic conduit is really an advanced design for industry .\n",
      "S However , just like plastic conduit , there are many engineering designs which have not developed into perfect innovations in China because of the problems exist now .\n",
      "S To sum up , China has a long way to go to meet the needs of engineering designs processes for innovations .\n",
      "S In the board sweep of scientific history , scientists have made a lot of discoveries via research .\n",
      "S In contrast , a lot of serendipitous discoveries were made at the same time .\n",
      "S As a serendipitous discovery , the discovery of penicillin is very different from the discovery of the DNA 's structure , because Alexander Fleming started to study penicillin by an accidental finding , but Watson and Crick started the research on the DNA 's structure based on Franklin 's previous study .\n",

      "S However , some of the unthinkable ideas were not created through research .\n",
      "S These creations are called serendipitous discoveries .\n",
      "S Often than not , they are chanced upon when the researchers are researching on something else instead .\n",
      "S Let us take a closer look at two examples , the electric car as technology that was developed via research and warfarin which was a result of a serendipitous discovery , and find out what are some of their similarities and differences in terms of their popularity , usefulness , production cost , and other usages .\n",
      "S Both the electric car and warfarin gained in popularity from the moment they were developed .\n",
      "S The electric cars were heavily marketed when the prototype became available .\n",
      "S Advertisements were put up in each local newspaper , inviting interested individuals to apply for an opportunity to test-drive the new vehicle .\n",
      "S The response turned out to be overwhelming .\n",
      "S According to Rogers E.M. ( 2003 ) , in Sacramento , with a population of close to half a million , seven thousand applied .\n",
      "S And though they were given thrity minutes after the test-drive to ask questions , they find that it was not enough to ask all the questions that they have in mind .\n",
      "S Also , when asked to hand out wallet-sized cards containing information on the electric cars , the test-drivers did it with passion .\n",
      "S They even asked for more cards when they finished giving out what they have .\n",
      "S As for warfarin , it was a big hit too as it was a very effective antidote against pests like rats and mice .\n",
      "S However , to this date , it has been overtaken by another stronger poison called brodifacoum .\n",
      "S This is because many rat populations have developed resistance to warfarin .\n",
      "S Therefore , a poison of greater potency is needed .\n",
      "S Another similarity between the two different innovations is that they are both useful in their own way .\n",
      "S The electric car is created as it does not pollute the air unlike gasoline vehicles .\n",
      "S The electric car is also lightweight and very quiet , which does not produce noise pollution as well .\n",
      "S Therefore , the electric car serves its purpose of being a clean and pollution-free car .\n",
      "S The warfarin is useful as rats causes a lot of problems especially to farmers , and warfarin is very effective against them .\n",
      "S Besides , it is not dangerous to humans who might happen to consume it .\n",
      "S Thus , both creations are very useful in the role they play in making our life a better one .\n",
      "S One difference between the two innovations is the production cost of each product .\n",
      "S The electric car is a large scale project where large amount of money is pumped into doing research in order to improve the car .\n",
      "S Besides that , each individual part that make up the car is also expensive .\n",
      "S As compared to the electric car , warfarin is a cheap product which is easily available in the market .\n",
      "S Another consideration that separates the electric car from warfarin is that the electric car only has one usage whereas warfarin has other usages besides being used as a pesticide .\n",
      "S The electric car is a vehicle used for transportation and that is its sole purpose .\n",
      "S Warfarin , on the other hand , can be used as an anticoagulant .\n",
      "S It is prescribed to people with an increased tendency for thrombosis , the formation of blood clot inside the blood vessel .\n",
      "S Warfarin can also help to prevent formation of future blood clots .\n",
      "S In conclusion , although technology can be created by means of doing research or by chance , there are still some similarities and differences between them .\n",

      "S On the surface , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment do not differ .\n",
      "S One similarity the two technologies share is that the process is tough .\n",
      "S Because of market demands , researchers have to work overloaded so as to come out the technology faster .\n",
      "S Besides , researchers have to repeat the same experiment hundreds of times until success .\n",
      "S For example , Edison decided to invent electric light after Ferrari invented electric motor .\n",
      "S After concluding previous experiences , Edison tried about 1600 different materials as filament with noting down each of their performances .\n",
      "S Besides , Edison also tried to vacuumize the lamp .\n",
      "S And finally all the efforts turned to be success that the first light in the world appeared in 1879 .\n",
      "S In addition , the two technology processes have another feature in common , that is researchers have to take all the uncertain consequences including a total failure during the process .\n",
      "S In other words , no matter the technology derives from a convention or it is definitely a new innovation , it has to be prepared for the worst outcome .\n",
      "S Sometimes the final product can not reach what people have expected , or the new innovation can not be accepted by public temporarily , then negative impacts may influence the continuing research .\n",
      "S Therefore , the two types of technologies are alike since tough jobs are required and researchers must be ready for any consequence given by the unpredicted market .\n",
      "S However , they also differ .\n",
      "S First of all , the length of the research process may differ .\n",
      "S As conventionally generated technology is always upgraded from a previous technology , in contrast , innovation is to come up with a total new technology which has fewer references .\n",
      "S Hence , developing a conventionally generated technology is always faster than coming up with an innovation .\n",
      "S Moreover , conventionally generated technology and innovation receive different attitudes from other people .\n",
      "S As conventionally generated technology obeys people 's psychological inertia so that it can easily satisfy people .\n",
      "S In addition , the previous technology it is based on may have already gained reputations , hence the majority of people will support the R&D process and the process is always under observation .\n",
      "S But when it comes to innovation , the conditions are quite different .\n",
      "S The researchers of the innovation may receive poor feedbacks in the prior market research , or someone even regard the researchers as idiots .\n",
      "S Thus normally the innovation has to be developed in a skunkworks environment .\n",
      "S Take the birth of the first Toshiba laptop as an example , initially the idea of the laptop could not be accepted by the organizational hierarchy of Toshiba .\n",
      "S However the engineer Mizoguchi persisted to research the laptop in a skunkworks environment , and finally he got the triumph and nowadays laptop is becoming essential in our daily life .\n",
      "S To conclude , conventionally generated technology and innovation created in a skunkworks environment are alike , yet different .\n",

      "S In recent years , Singapore has placed more and more emphasis on research and development , establishing her status of being home to innovations .\n",
      "S Annually , millions of funds are being pumped into the R&D sector to encourage innovations to offer solutions to the pressing challenges Singapore faces .\n",
      "S Indeed , great success has been achieved , for instance Singapore 's clean water technology is widely recognized by the world .\n",
      "S The large scale research and development effort has placed Singapore as the leader in new water technologies especially in membrane applications .\n",
      "S Despite her huge success in many areas , Singapore does face problems which hamper engineering design processes for innovations .\n",
      "S One problem faced by engineering design in Singapore is the various restrictions due to socio-political system of the country .\n",
      "S Innovations are restricted by the many rules and regulations the country imposed , and sometimes the over emphasis of specific policies which causes development of ideas in an irrelevant area to be neglected .\n",
      "S Singapore is renowned for her strict implementation of rules , and in times it may be seen as too inflexible .\n",
      "S As such , innovations in the contentious areas are often restricted .\n",
      "S The ideas eventually accepted are shaped primarily by commercial interests and governmental policies .\n",
      "S In recent years , the core objectives of the country 's research and development project have been directed in the area of clean energy and water technology .\n",
      "S Various programmes have been initiated to establish Singapore as the Global Clean Energy Hub , for instance the Clean Energy Research Programme , which is a competitive funding scheme to encourage innovations in this area .\n",
      "S However , the over exertion of her efforts may simply cause innovations in the other areas to be neglected .\n",
      "S As a result , innovation process is interrupted at the stage of research and development with the absence of supports and attention .\n",
      "S Aside from this , innovations that are radically different face even greater problems in being accepted .\n",
      "S This can be attributed to the inflexibility of the system causing rejection of innovations that is less relevant with the corporate or country 's interest .\n",
      "S Another problem faced by engineers in Singapore is the limitations in resources .\n",
      "S Despite having the most advance infrastructure , the best institute for research , Singapore still lacks the resources for certain development .\n",
      "S Due to her limitations , innovations in some areas are restricted since the accessibility to resources would be too difficult and pose potential problems .\n",
      "S High cost may be incurred for certain research when scarce resource or externally imported resources involved .\n",
      "S Foreign experts may also be engaged to facilitate researches .\n",
      "S Hence the lack of resources adds hindrance to the process of innovation .\n",
      "S Aside from the lack of resources for the research and development stage , difficulties may be faced in finding suitable target group for the innovation result within the country .\n",
      "S The low population of the country disables experimentation on a large scale basic which eventually may cause inaccuracy in the result .\n",
      "S Indeed just earlier this year , a team of National University of Singapore researchers find themselves facing this problem .\n",
      "S The team came up with a chair that turns sound into vibrations , which can potentially help the deaf to experience sound better .\n",
      "S However , a problem was faced when they attempt to test out the chair .\n",
      "S They could not get access to enough deaf children locally for the test thus had to travel to Sri Lanka for the test out .\n",
      "S In the engineering of the eco-car , it is also evident that the lack of resources poses great deal of challenges to the team of NUS students , having to import the materials outside of Singapore .\n",
      "S Hence the process of engineering design is hampered by the lack of resource not only at stages of research and development , but also in the diffusion of the innovation .\n",
      "S In conclusion , despite Singapore 's efforts in establishing herself as the Home for Innovations , engineer are compelled by several restrictions such as lack of resources and the inflexibility of the social system .\n",
      "S However , it does not mean engineering design in Singapore is not favorable .\n",
      "S In fact , great success has been achieved in some areas where it face less restrictions .\n",
      "S In the 21st century , everything develops in a very fast pace .\n",
      "S The needs of human beings increase .\n",
      "S In order to meet the people 's needs , the engineers or scientists start to do research and design something for the people 's sake .\n",
      "S They keep on trying and repeating the experiments , and eventually succeed to generate a new technology .\n",
      "S The serendipitous discovery of new ideas therefore , sometimes comes out during the trials .\n",
      "S No matter the technology was resulted from a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , this technology must have been done by a group or an individual who has already acquired certain knowledge .\n",
      "S They are believed to have undergone many researches and discussions .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , six main stages are involved in the way to come out the technology , they are recognizing a problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences .\n",
      "S This is not an easy works but requires times and efforts to deal with it .\n",
      "S Moreover , although the serendipitous idea is not the desirable outcome , it benefits the world .\n",
      "S The notable example that I want to discuss here is penicillin .\n",
      "S It was accidentally discovered by Alexander Fleming during his investigation about the properties of staphylococci .\n",
      "S This antibiotic is the first drug that is effective against the syphilis and staphylococcus infections .\n",
      "S It successfully saved the people who suffered from the diseases and gave them happiness to have the chance to live again .\n",
      "S Similarly , the discovery of laptop benefits the individual , the society and the world .\n",
      "S It saves the people whose surrounding 's space is small and compact , brings a lot of conveniences to the society .\n",
      "S Nowadays laptop has combined with many functions such as camera , microphone , wi-fi receiver and so on .\n",
      "S We do n't need to buy the devices and it will actually save many spaces .\n",
      "S Every time when we want to discuss assignments with friends , we ca n't bring along the conventional desktop to anywhere .\n",
      "S With the invention of portable personal computer , we can now bring along it to wherever we like !\n",
      "S In spite of the benefits that both serendipitous discovery and research discovery have , there actually exist differences of the two technologies .\n",
      "S The laptop is a product after somebody generates the idea and plans the procedures to make it out .\n",
      "S It is a product after the consideration of the safety and functions .\n",
      "S Step by step , from design , fabricate to assemble .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is a quite safe design for us to use .\n",
      "S However , we actually take a higher risk of the side-effect to consume the penicillin .\n",
      "S Penicillin is a serendipitous discovery .\n",
      "S We only know that the penicillin can cure the syphilis disease , but we will never know what diseases might be caused by consuming penicillin as there exists a lot of uncertainties .\n",
      "S In brief , the two products , laptop and penicillin , are either generated through a long period of research or a serendipitous discovery , they are both made out to meet the people 's requirements .\n",
      "S Although they may not be the best outcome to fulfil the people 's needs , they still lead the world to a technological innovation .\n",
      "S Topic : How electrical dictionary is shaped by students ' need and the specific factors that have shaped its innovation .\n",
      "S I have been witnessed the development of electronic dictronary .\n",
      "S From the huge one with the simplest function to today 's lovely and multi-functional one , electronic dictronary have been refined again and again .\n",
      "S By saying electronic dictronary , I refer to the small handheld computer which people commonly use to look up words .\n",
      "S The development of electronic dictronary is deeply shaped by the need of students , who are the majority of their customers .\n",
      "S In the latter paragraphs , i will talk about how students ' need determine the development of electronic dictronary .\n",
      "S The most obevious change is that the function of electronic dictronary has greatly improved due to the change in students demand .\n",
      "S At the very beginning , it can do nothing but look up words .\n",
      "S In comparision , nowadays electronic dictronary are much more multi-functional .\n",
      "S For example , it can not only look up words in Chinese and English as the old one does , but also many other languages , like Japanese and Franch as well .\n",
      "S It is intellectualized , which enables the users to enrich their electronic dictronary as they like .\n",
      "S And what they need to do is simply downloading programms and install them in the electronic dictronary .\n",
      "S Moreover , as students are not content with a boring study tool , electronic dictronary today can act as good company during leisure time because it possesses the function of MP3/MP4 player and even PSP !\n",
      "S Another significant improvement is the appearance of electronic dictronary .\n",
      "S Instead of the hand-size one , it is only lemon-size big now with a much lighter weight .\n",
      "S As a direct result , it is convience to carry and win students ' regards .\n",
      "S As English is a complusary course to learn in China , electronic dictronary has almost become a necessity to students .\n",
      "S And nearly everyone has one .\n",
      "S Thus it is not simply a tool , but a personal belonging to reprsent their appitite and modernise .\n",
      "S The electronic dictronary with an outstanding look allows students to show off around their fellows .\n",
      "S So the surface becomes bright-colored and beautifully decorated .\n",
      "S All these changes are aimed to cater for students taste and finally attract their attention .\n",
      "S Last but not least , the price of electronic dictronary is also influenced by students .\n",
      "S As students do not have job , they have to ask their parents for money .\n",
      "S Hence they can not spend too much on an electronic dictronary .\n",
      "S In addition , the limitation of electronic dictronary , such as no access to the the Internet , also determines that the price of electronic dictronary can not be too high .\n",
      "S It can not be as expensive as a computer .\n",
      "S In conclusion , electronic dictronary plays an importance role in students ' study , and students in return shape and decide the development of electronic dictronary in many aspects , like price , appearance and function .\n",
      "S It can be seen that as technology develops , electronic dictronary will be more and more helpful to students .\n",
      "S Before a technology innovation is developed and patented , scientists have to go through a tedious research process most of the time .\n",
      "S However , there are also occasional chances that R&D workers fortuitously discover an invention when they were actually pursuing something else .\n",
      "S Whichever way an invention is created , it helps satisfy human needs and solve existing problems .\n",
      "S However , there are still differences between a technology developed with via research such as the electric car and one serendipitously discovered like penicillin .\n",
      "S All technological innovations , regardless of their developing process , help solve world problems .\n",
      "S In view of the increasing emphasis of eco friendliness , the US General Motor R&D unit developed the electric car IMPACT during the early 1990s .\n",
      "S This development received great responses from people throughout the US as it signifies one big step towards solving existing environmental problems such as the global warming .\n",
      "S Similarly , Alexander Fleming 's discovery of Penicillin made many deadly diseases such as Tuberculosis curable .\n",
      "S This groundbreaking discovery also won Fleming a Nobel Prize .\n",
      "S Therefore , the common factor of all technological developments is that they address existing social problems , in one way or another .\n",
      "S However , there are still differences between an innovation that is developed via continuous research and one that is serendipitously discovered .\n",
      "S These discrepancies can be further categorized in terms of their purpose , procedure and effect .\n",
      "S The conventional innovation process requires the engineers to first identify a human need before the research officially begin .\n",
      "S This ensures that the research has a proper target .\n",
      "S Take the development of electric cars as an example , engineers recognized the increasing emphasis on eco friendliness , and therefore developed the vehicle without fuel powered engine to ease global warming .\n",
      "S On the other hand , a serendipitously discovered product is not the preset goal that the researchers want to achieve .\n",
      "S Its application is realized after the product has already been created .\n",
      "S Alexander Fleming did not expect to discover penicillin mould when he left the petri dish containing Staphylococcus plate culture open .\n",
      "S Therefore , an innovation involving continuous research and development differs from an accidental discovery as the former is a rational problem solving process while the latter is more of a lucky surprise .\n"

      "S Apart from the difference in purpose , the conventional innovation products and the one serendipitously discovered also undergo different research and development procedures .\n",
      "S The conventional products usually go through careful planning stages , making the whole development process well prepared .\n",
      "S These innovations are usually backed by solid technological background , expertise and sufficient funds .\n",
      "S GM allocated $ 2 billion for designing , manufacturing and marketing of their electric car IMPACT , after which expert diffusion scholars helped in campaigning for the product throughout the United States .\n",
      "S Within one year , the first tier of cars was put into mass production .\n",
      "S On the contrary , when Fleming discovered penicillin mould , he then had to refer his discovery to Charles Thom , an American specialist for further research .\n",
      "S It took more than 10 years for penicillin to be eventually purified and applied to medical use .\n",
      "S Lastly , the immediate effectiveness of a conventional innovation may be more conspicuous than that of a fortuitous discovery .\n",
      "S The centralized research procedure gives engineers more careful thoughts in the development of a conventional innovation .\n",
      "S The technological product created is thus more sophiscated and addresses human need more directly .\n",
      "S On the other hand , accidental discovery may be too crude for actual application immediately .\n",
      "S After Fleming had discovered penicillin , a series of specialists , including himself , had to carry out tedious research trials to further improve penicillin to ensure stable reaction on human bodies .\n",
      "S In conclusion , technological products developed via research do differ from those serendipitous discoveries in terms of their purposes , research procedures and immediate effects .\n",
      "S Despite of this fact , these products all serve to solve existing problems .\n",
      "S Yet technological innovation is not like a lottery game .\n",
      "S Instead , it should be a conscientious and exact pursuit of solutions .\n",
      "S Although there are occasional lucky winners , engineers should still put in every endeavour in all research processes .\n",
      "S Technological innovations shaped the modern lifestyle .\n",
      "S We use electricity , watch television , surfing around the billions of website every day .\n",
      "S Some of those inventions have become an essential part of our life and we can not live without these inventions .\n",
      "S However , it is clear that these inventions are not produced overnight and human beings had put in a lot of time and efforts to develop and generate them .\n",
      "S Generally , innovations can be generated in two ways -- conventional research or skunkwork .\n",
      "S There are some differences and similarities between the technologies created in the two different backgrounds .\n",
      "S One of the main differences between conventionally generated technology and skunkwork product is the speed of generating the product .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , skunkwork refers to a small group of highly selected people designated to do research for an innovation without carry out tedious organization procedures .\n",
      "S While conventional research requires the researchers to do large amount of reports , discussions and management procedures , skunkwork provides pathway to develop an invention quickly without being constrained by bureaucratic processes .\n",
      "S Therefore , innovations that were created in a skunkwork environment are usually created faster than those inventions created by conventional research .\n",
      "S For example , Roger ( 2003 ) states that the skunkwork of producing laptop , lead by Mizoguchi , involves 10 engineers from military projects and takes only 24 months to complete .\n",
      "S In contrast , a conventionally generated technology may not have move that fast .\n",
      "S Conventional research involves a lot of management procedures .\n",
      "S The research must be approved by the corporate leaders before it can be carried out .\n",
      "S Therefore , conventionally generated technology usually moves slower than that of the skunkwork production .\n",
      "S The second difference is the flexibility in making changes to generate a new technology .\n",
      "S Conventional researches must undergo step-by-step managements to maintain the continuity and stability of a company .\n",
      "S However , it does not favour the technological development .\n",
      "S A good illustration was the failure of Xerox PARC in bringing their outstanding technologies into marketplace .\n",
      "S According to Roger ( 2003 ) , Xerox PARC employed numerous talented researchers and developed outstanding personal computing technology .\n",
      "S However , the corporation restricted itself to develop only in office copier business , not in microcomputer business .\n",
      "S In contrast , skunkwork provides an alternative which is beneficial to technological inventions as well as organization procedure .\n",
      "S The specified team was given resources and freedom to develop and make changes as they see any problem in the invention .\n",
      "S As a result , skunkwork innovations are more flexible and more able to adapt to changes than the conventionally generated technology .\n",
      "S However , there are some similarities between conventionally generated technologies and the skunkwork innovations .\n",
      "S Generally , both ways served to provide better life to the society and gives profit to the company .\n",
      "S For instance , a conventionally generated invention , electric refrigerator was produced to meet the needs of human .\n",
      "S At the same time , the company earned a lot of money from this invention .\n",
      "S On the other hand , skunkwork innovation , such as the production of Toshiba laptop enables users to bring laptop to anywhere .\n",
      "S This invention also makes a lot of profit to the company .\n",
      "S To sum up , conventionally generated technology and skunkwork invention bear some differences and shares some common points .\n",
      "S Although they differs in the procedure throughout the development of a technology , the 2 ways are heading towards a common goalto produce a better environment for human beings .\n",
      "S 1 .\n",
      "S Define the problem\n",
      "S Engineering design process is a suitable method that allows engineers to analyze the problems and developing solutions to it .\n",
      "S It breaks down those critical sections and allows the project to proceed in an orderly manner with proper guidelines .\n",
      "S The following is an example of using engineering design process as an approach to solve the problem .\n",
      "S The topic that is catching most attention nowadays would be on global warming or climatic change .\n",
      "S Many engineers and scientists are brainstorming for new ideas to prevent global warming from worsening .\n",
      "S Identify and Establish the Need , Develop a Problem Statement\n",
      "S There are many different views and stands about global warming , discussions are still carrying out between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and delegates from oil and gas industry .\n",
      "S Regardless of the conclusion , at the end of the day , we are still required to prepare for the worst situation .\n",
      "S How can planet Earth and the entire human species escape from this impending crisis ?\n",
      "S Many people have been trying tremendously hard in reducing the carbon emission by using clean energy or going into a vegetarian diet .\n",
      "S These methods do work , but only minority of the population is doing it , and results could only be seen after many years of efforts .\n",
      "S Establish Criteria for Success\n",
      "S Earth is heated up by the Sun 's energy and many believe that the increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere worsen global warming by retaining more heat .\n",
      "S Instead of reducing the carbon emission , we can solve this impending crisis by finding some methods that reduces the heat source or able to manipulate the heat input onto Earth .\n",
      "S 2 .\n",
      "S Gather pertinent information\n",
      "S Search for Information Resources\n",
      "S Research has shown that whenever a volcano erupts , it releases large amount of dust and gaseous chemicals causing a thick layer of haze to form around the planet , thus reducing the average temperature of Earth by almost one degree Fahrenheit .\n",
      "S 3 .\n",
      "S Generate multiple solutions\n",
      "S According to National Geographic ( August , 2009 ) , the 'Big Idea ' is to launch millions of reflective particles or tiny 'sun shades ' into space ( between the Earth and the Sun ) .\n",
      "S These ideas may sound ludicrous , however it is the easiest method that enables us to store more time while we change our lifestyle and prepares for global warming .\n",
      "S 4 .\n",
      "S Analyze and select a solution\n",
      "S Launching a few huge sunshades at the altitude , especially at the poles and oceans , this allows some of the heat to be reflected away from them , thus reducing the temperature and melting of glaciers .\n",
      "S Our oceans absorb tremendous quantities of heat that was emitted by the Sun due to the high heat capacity of water .\n",
      "S A relationship is established between the rising sea level and the rise in temperature ( or carbon dioxide concentration ) , the graph below is taken from a scientific journal 'Climatic Dynamics ' which shows us the relationship .\n",

      "S Launching of sunshades has two advantages , firstly to store enough time to change our lifestyle permanently , example reduce in poultry consumption , reducing the usage of non-environmental friendly materials .\n",
      "S Secondly , to develop more advance technologies such as clean fuel and energy conserving systems .\n",
      "S However , this is not a permanent solution to solve the problem , it is a mitigation step that slows down the crisis from occurring .\n",
      "S It is necessary for us to remove those \" sunshades \" when Earth starts to cool down , glaciers reform and most importantly , when we ( humans ) are ready .\n",
      "S Ergonomics , Product Safety and Liability and Mechanical/Strength Analysis\n",
      "S Locating the sunshades at remote areas , reduce the probability of injuries in case of any accident .\n",
      "S The material use for the sunshades will mainly be some reflective materials , example sulfate .\n",
      "S It is important that the sunshades are able to stay within the designated area when the Earth orbits around the Sun .\n",
      "S Sunshades switch over would be carry out periodically , as maintenance work could be quite tedious as changing of parts will requires the sun shades to ascend down .\n",
      "S High durability , battery life and able to function at low temperatures must be considered during the design phase .\n",
      "S Economic and Market Analysis\n",
      "S This method allows us to combat global warming easily and fastest compared to many other solutions .\n",
      "S Ken Caldeira , a climate expert at the Carnegie Institution said , \" If a country starts thinking it 's in their vital interests to do this , and they have the power , I find it hard to imagine them not doing it .\n",
      "S \"\n",
      "S In brief , geoengineering solution allows us to fight global warming temporary , it is just a mitigation approach and not a preventive one .\n",
      "S It is still dependent on us to start changing our lifestyle and cut down on carbon emissions , just in case the sunshades fail , the crisis that we have been masking would soon rush towards us at once .\n",
      "S Two problems in China that hamper engineering designing process\n",
      "S Engineering designing plays a key role in technological innovation .\n",
      "S According to Seyyed Khandani ( 2005 ) , engineering design includes creating technological products which have never existed before and improving the existing devices or systems .\n",
      "S There are five basic steps for solving a design problem : define the problem , gather pertinent information , generate multiple solutions , analyze and select a solution , and test and implement the solution .\n",
      "S Although the description of the designing process is simple and clear , the implement of engineering design is rather complicated and requires several crucial qualities .\n",
      "S Two of the most important qualities are creative thinking skills and intensive working habbit .\n",
      "S However , two problems in China deprived them of these two qualities .\n",
      "S First of all , Chinese education system largely destroyed students ' creative thinking skills .\n",
      "S Inovative thinking contains natural curiosity and bold imagination whereas analytical thinking is comprised of experiences .\n",
      "S The schools in China usually aim at cultivating students ' analytical skills by teaching them knowledge and testing them on the knowledge been taught .\n",
      "S But the education system does n't encourage students to think out of the box to give their own answers or to explore the mysterious world .\n",
      "S This \" education for examination \" strategy have two negative impact on engineering design .\n",
      "S First , it prevents students from detecting real problems by themselves which is essential in the first step of engineering design .\n",
      "S As the experiences filling up students ' minds , their curiosity is fading day by day until they do n't even bother to take notice the world surrounding them .\n",
      "S In addition , it limits the possible solutions students could come up with , therefore hampers the third step .\n",
      "S Examination often denies imagination .\n",
      "S Hence students gradually lose the ability to conceive fresh ideas .\n",
      "S However , the best way to solve a problem may not be taught by lecturers and books .\n",
      "S Sometimes , we need to use our own brain to find it out .\n",
      "S Secondly , Chinese society destracted engineers from devoting into innovative work .\n",
      "S In scientific world , most of the greatest contributers are from western countires ; the only two Chinese scientist who won Nobel Prize developed their theories in America .\n",
      "S Similarly , in technological area , Chinese engineers seldom have breakthroughs .\n",
      "S These phenomena can be largely subscribed to the impulsive atmosphere of Chinese society .\n",
      "S As a result of the impulsive atmosphere , Chinese government focused too much on economic development but input too little on technological research .\n",
      "S Compared with the developed countries , China stressed more on implement rather than generation of engineering design .\n",
      "S Besides the indifference from government , engineers also did n't attach much importance to engineering design .\n",
      "S Engineering design is a meaningful work but requires lots of sacrifice and devotion since it could n't generate benefits promplty and directly .\n",
      "S Hence , this impulsive atmosphere seriously impacts the whole engineering design .\n",
      "S The lack of innovative thinking skills and the indifference to the creative work have already hampered Chinese engineering design .\n",
      "S To promote creative-centered research and design , China have to transform greatly in these two dimensions .\n",

      "S The Prime Minister in his National Day Rally speech gave immense significance to healthcare .\n",
      "S With health being the subject of conversation in most places , it would not be wrong to classify good health as a need in today 's world .\n",
      "S The measures taken to improve the healthcare system worldwide ranges from the fundamental implementation of affordable healthcare in poor countries to the more advanced introduction of stem cell research .\n",
      "S With one notion of improving the healthcare system , man has even delved into surgery assisted by robots .\n",
      "S Some might find this assisted surgery difficult to fathom while others might argue about the competency of such a system .\n",
      "S Amidst all these opposition , the Da Vinci surgical system rose prominently from the California company intuitive surgical .\n",
      "S This Da Vinci surgical system would not have been made possible without the engineering design process as described by Khandani .\n",
      "S The engineering design process gears up with , first , defining and understanding a problem , The brainchild of the Da Vinci surgical system was the primary need to make the surgical process a less invasive one .\n",
      "S To put it in better words , it was to reduce the size of incisions and to forego the need to crack bones or rib cages .\n",
      "S The problem in this case is the intrusiveness of the surgical procedure on the human body .\n",
      "S With the problem reinstated , it then becomes crucial to mark down the requirements towards accomplishing the design .\n",
      "S However , as mentioned by Khandani , following the development of the design solution , these requirements will have to reviewed later .\n",
      "S Initially , the requirements for this design to kick start were its effectiveness in performing surgery , its ability to be user-friendly and the capacity of it to work without posing potential danger to the patient .\n",
      "S Overall , with the base of the design process carefully established , it would be easier to get to the imminent task .\n",
      "S Following the defining of the problem was the task of gathering sufficient information .\n",
      "S Lack of information would turn out to be potentially lethal to any design process and the Da Vinci surgical system was no exception to this .\n",
      "S The spectrum of information was spread out in all ways , from the need to understand possible fallbacks in the design process to previous attempts at creating the surgical system .\n",
      "S Khandani in his viewpoint mentioned various sources of information like the internet and library .\n",
      "S Information , being a liabilty , will first have to be sourced out and then scrutinized to the minute details .\n",
      "S With information as a good layback , the design can grace the next stage which is the formulation of many solutions to the problem .\n",
      "S With concised understanding of the problem and important information , the design will move to the next stage of creating solutions .\n",
      "S A single solution alone will not be able to suffice in making the design a roaring success .\n",
      "S A good engineer will have to contemplate on various solutions and from various angles .\n",
      "S After gathering various solutions to the problem at hand , Khandhani suggested narrowing down to one solution after considering the pros and cons of each solution .\n",
      "S Making surgery less invasive could mean inventing other instruments but the reason a robot was chosen signifies the importance of surgery .\n",
      "S The lives of patients can not be placed in jeopardy and inventing a design that comprises on safety of the patient was an absolute no .\n",
      "S In the case of the Da Vinci surgical system , it will not be able to function unless it detects the presence of the surgeon 's head in the viewer .\n",
      "S This was indication that the surgery was still in safe hands and was the best solution to making surgery less invasive .\n",
      "S Therefore the solution was specified and the design process was nearing completion .\n",
      "S Having a solution to the problem did not indicate a successful design process until the design was tested and implemented .\n",
      "S This stage depicts the take off of the design for the first time after many trial attempts and failures .\n",
      "S Khandani in his article mentioned four sub categories in the take off which are namely prototyping , concurrent engineering , documentation and applying for patents .\n",
      "S A good engineer will have to consider these sub categories before his creation takes place .\n",
      "S In context to the Da Vinci surgical system , take off of the system also meant clearance by the FDA .\n",

      "S July 2000 was a significant date in the history of the Da Vinci surgical system and was a mark that the world was taking the first step towards digital surgery .\n",
      "S July 2000 was the date the surgical system could perform advanced surgical techniques .\n",
      "S The opportunity to test and implement meant that the surgical system was ready to start its race in addressing health concerns .\n",

      "S The impediment in the way to innovation in China\n",
      "S In ancient China , there were four great inventions , the gunpowder , printing , the compass and paper making .\n",
      "S However in modern times , the engineering design developed very slowly .\n",
      "S Why did this happen ?\n",
      "S I think there are many reasons .\n",
      "S In the Qing dynasty , the governing class implemented closed door policy , which made the society stagnated for a long time .\n",
      "S Then the Cultural Revolution made a deep effect on Chinese society which needed another long time for China to recovery .\n",
      "S Even nowadays there are still some problems existed which hamper the engineering design process .\n",
      "S Here we are going to talk about two problems , the examination-oriented education system and the worship of authorities .\n",
      "S The examination-oriented education , as the name implies , is the education whose purpose is getting high grades in the exam .\n",
      "S Teachers teach for the exam .\n",
      "S Students study for the exam .\n",
      "S This results that students have high scores but low abilities .\n",
      "S In the first stage of the engineering design process--define the problem , people need an active mind to design problem , but many students under the examination-oriented education system only know how to use their knowledge to answer the question on the examination paper , they do not know how to use knowledge to solve the real problems .\n",
      "S In the third step of the design processgenerate multiple solutions , this needs divergent thinking and analytical skills , whereas the examinationoriented education do not emphasis the importance of thinking and skills .\n",
      "S Its only purpose is high score in the exam .\n",
      "S The skills which needed in the design process can not be gain from such an education system .\n",
      "S Chinese educationalists have noticed this problem .\n",
      "S They have implemented another education system , education for allrounded development , which emphasis that developing students ' abilities is the most important thing .\n",
      "S In China , the worship of authorities is blind .\n",
      "S Authorities are always right and can not be queried .\n",
      "S This is also not good for people to design for innovation .\n",
      "S To generate multiple solutions , it needs to try new ways audaciously .\n",
      "S However , people always can not break the shackle of the authorities .\n",
      "S They do not dare to challenge the authorities .\n",
      "S This may owe to the class concept in China .\n",
      "S Under shackles , no good ideas will be gotten .\n",
      "S The blind worship of authorities also will hamper the academic exchange between the authorities and students .\n",
      "S Rogers have said in the generation of innovation , \" the innovationdevelopment process is , most of all , driven by the exchange of technical information in the face of high degree of uncertainty \" .\n",
      "S That is to say that the exchange of information is very important for innovation .\n",
      "S These problems hampered the process of engineering design for innovation .\n",
      "S When there are problems , there also must be some ways to solve the problems .\n",
      "S China has already find ways to solve these problems , but solving these problems needs time .\n",
      "S I believe that one day there is no problem in the way to innovation in China .\n",
      "S Technologies have changed and advanced over the years , leading to the birth of many innovations we are using today .\n",
      "S In the midst of using these technologies today , we can view them from either a technologically determinist perspective or a socially determinist perspective .\n",
      "S To look from the former point of view , it means that the technology has played a part in shaping the society today .\n",
      "S While viewing from the latter would suggest that it is due to the societal factors that has shaped the technology today ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S The electric car is an example of a socially determined technology , which came about due to factors from the different sectors of the society , such as the economy , government and the environment .\n",
      "S In view of the rising fuel prices in the recent decade , car manufacturers have addressed the need to reduce costs in production , so as to be able to pass on minimal costs to the consumers , yet still remain competitive and appealing in the market .\n",
      "S To invest , research and produce the electric car is a good deal in the long run , mainly because the car runs on electricity that is of a much lower cost than fuel .\n",
      "S Furthermore , this would reduce the dependency on fuel in the future for cars , should one day the world has run out of fuel .\n",
      "S With this in mind , the car manufacturer General Motors embarked on a $ 2 billion project on designing , manufacturing and marketing the electric vehicles in the early 1990s ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S They had received an overwhelming response from the masses to test-drive the new car when they launched their test-drive campaign .\n",
      "S Mavens , who were specialists and consultants in their own field of expertise , were selected .\n",
      "S They provided opinions and disseminating the information of the electric car to the larger market , which eventually boosted the total car sales of GM when they officially launched their first electric car into the market in the late 1990s ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S From the economic viewpoint , the technology of the electric car would benefit the manufacturers from the reductions of their production costs in the long run , and this would spur them on to increase their production with improved technology .\n",
      "S One of the more outstanding features of an electric car is its non-polluting factor .\n",
      "S With increased global warming and rapid emissions of greenhouse gases from factories and fuel-powered vehicles , there is an urgent need to reduce these emissions and the clean technology of the electric car is one of the solutions to address the environmental concerns .\n",
      "S To invest in the green technology would therefore require a significant amount of financial resources , and to encourage continuation in this area of research , the government plays a role as a banker to grant incentives to these companies .\n",
      "S In early August this year , US President Obama had announced that incentives of $ 2.4 billion are to be pumped into the development of the eco-friendly technology ( CNN.com , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S With the financial aid from the government and the promising potential sales of the electric cars in the market , the car manufacturers are much complied to design , improve and thus , market these cars while the heat is still on .\n",
      "S Even back in the 1990s , the government had already taken action to encourage the innovation of electric cars .\n",
      "S The California and Arizona state governments had announced and made compulsory for 10 per cent of the total car sales in the market to be environmentally-friendly , so as to reduce the pollution levels in their states ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Social construction of technology is also what called as the social determinist technology .\n",
      "S The electric car is clearly an example of such technology because as early as 1990s , the environmental issues were already present such that the government had to take action to mitigate the situation .\n",
      "S It was only due to economic reasons recently that the production of electric cars is stepped up .\n",
      "S Behind the scenes , the birth of the technology of the electric car is primarily due to the society reasons then , and even till today , the electric car is constantly being re-designed and improvised with better technology so as to remain competitive in the market and most importantly , eco-friendly on the roads .\n",
      "S There is a legend that has been fascinating people from some one thousand year ago : God was going to send a deluge to destroy the earth and almost all the living things on earth which had become corrupt .\n",
      "S However , taking pity on what he had created , he instructed Noah to build a big vessel to save some species of the creatures .\n",
      "S Ultimately , the great flood wiped out all the beings except those Noah have conserved on the ark .\n",
      "S This Bible version of saving the dying out creatures inspired scientists to work on a new \" Noah Ark \" , or a \" doomsday \" conservancy , to store genetic materials in case of future use for both scientific purpose and biological diversity .\n",
      "S However , this time , the one who destroys the earth is no more the god but human beings themselves .\n",
      "S As a matter of fact , the Earth 's population is currently increasing , coupled with pollution , urban sprawl , deforestation , and climate warming which caused serious damages to the habitats of the plants and animals .\n",
      "S These series of human activities with their negative effects on the environment directly lead to an inevitable consequence : species extinction .\n",
      "S Dr. Donald A. Levin , Professor of Biology , University of Texas , Austin once claimed in the January-February issue of American Scientist magazine , \" Although the extinction of various species is a natural phenomenon , the rate of extinction occurring in today 's world is exceptional -- as many as 100 to1,000 times greater than normal .\n",
      "S \" The alarm-bells have been rung , which draws worldwide attention .\n",
      "S Both scientists and environmentalists are endeavoring to change the situation , and fortunately there is good news for those who really care about the endangered creatures .\n",
      "S Besides the set up biological laboratories , various kinds of DNA repositories have been built while more plans are under way .\n",
      "S So far , there are already more than 1,400 seed banks in the world , in addition to those are intended for both plants and animal DNA storage .\n",
      "S A technical question may be raised from the public : how to store DNA ?\n",
      "S Newspapers revealed some information on this issue .\n",
      "S Genetic material Samples are placed inside tiny vials , which then were put into numbered boxes with special code respectively .\n",
      "S The temperatures of vats storing the species are normally adjusted to -160 to -18 degrees Celsius depending on different species .\n",
      "S In the vats there is liquid nitrogen , but samples are perched above 20 centimeters of it to let the vapor , instead of the liquid itself cool and preserve the genetic information .\n",
      "S As such , specimens can be perfectly stored for some 1000 years .\n",
      "S However , can the problem of species extinction really be solved by this technology ?\n",
      "S Since this particular technology came into being under the influence of human activities , it will definitely continue changing .\n",
      "S In other words , when the technology becomes more mature and more profitable in the future ( which is very possible ) , it is very hard to guarantee that it will only be put into good use .\n",
      "S What if the issue involves crime , disease or simply moral controversy like cloning ?\n",
      "S The outcome remains to be seen .\n",
      "S Anyway , social requirement created it and it is meeting the allowable needs for the time being .\n",

      "S Technologies have the capabilities of solving problems and improving on our daily life .\n",
      "S In order to come out with useful technologies , Rogers ( 2003 ) states that the process involves research for more in depth understanding of scientific knowledge , followed by research to solve specific problem and finally , development of the technologies .\n",
      "S However , in the mist of researching on a particular technology , discovery of new technologies may appear unexpectedly .\n",
      "S There are both similarities and differences between technologies developed via research and technologies resulted from a serendipitous discovery .\n",
      "S For example , the invention of laptops and the discovery of 3M Post-it pads respectively .\n",
      "S Laptops and Post-it pads are both favorable to us in one way or another .\n",
      "S In the case where space constraint is of concern , laptops will be the solution .\n",
      "S This is due to the fact that the size of laptops is much smaller than desktop computers as the latter consist of monitors as well as central processing units ( CPU ) .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , \" the laptop made particular sense in Japan , due to crowded offices and small homes \" .\n",
      "S Similarly , the 3M Post-it pads are useful to us in our daily life .\n",
      "S With Post-its , any notes , instructions or reminders can be written on it and attached to \" a letter or other document \" ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , both inventions are beneficial to us .\n",
      "S The two technologies also possess another similarity , that is , they are both profitable .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , laptops demand increased from 5,000 units per month in 1986 to 100,000 in 1989 .\n",
      "S Nowadays , laptops are still widely used all over the world by students as well as businessmen .\n",
      "S This infers that laptops are doing well in the market .\n",
      "S Likewise , Post-it pads are \" one of the 3M 's most profitable products \" ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , both the laptops and the Post-it pads are profitable .\n",
      "S However , between these two technologies , one of their differences is how the idea came about .\n",
      "S For invention of laptops , idea came about when there was a problem to be solved , which is , \" due to crowded offices and small homes \" ( Rogers , 2003 ) in Japan .\n",
      "S On the other hand , for the 3M Post-it pads , the unexpected discovery came about when 3M researchers are investigating on a new adhesive ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , the creation of Post-it pads is unintentional while creation of laptop is with intended purposes .\n",
      "S Another difference between the two technologies is regarding the room for further development .\n",
      "S For laptops , advancements are constantly introduced to attract the market .\n",
      "S For example , there are faster processors and more internal memory space being incorporated .\n",
      "S In addition to that , shrinking of laptops sizes and the variations of designs makes them even more attractive than before .\n",
      "S There will surely be more enhancements to come in the near future .\n",
      "S However , for Post-it pads , the developments are probably limited to colors , shapes , size and the extent of how sticky it is .\n",
      "S Hence , in terms of future developments , laptops may have a better prospect as compared to Post- it pads .\n",
      "S In conclusion , both technologies , which were either developed by research or by chance , have its similarities as well as differences .\n",
      "S Although there are certain differences between them , the characteristics that both are profitable and useful in our daily life operation in one way or the other are important elements when developing a technology .\n",
      "S Therefore , no matter whether the creation is based on research or luck , as long as it benefits us in one way or the other , it is a great invention .\n",

      "S The engineering design processes as described by Khandani ( 2005 ) provides a well-rounded methodology to come up with solutions to a need .\n",
      "S The process starts with identifying the underlying cause of the need to effectively solve the problem at hand , followed by research on the topic for better understanding .\n",
      "S Brainstorming for solutions comes next and the engineer lists out all the possible solutions for self-critique later .\n",
      "S Armed with more information on the problem , the engineer would be able to make better decisions on the final solution to optimise on and adaptation as a prototype .\n",
      "S The focus of this essay is ; however , on the ways the engineering design processes help fulfil a particular need .\n",
      "S Therefore the final step of implementing the solution will not be discussed .\n",
      "S In 1997 , a group of countries agreed to commit to the Kyoto Protocol , which aims towards a reduction of greenhouse gases emitted in view of the potential climatic changes to come should the situation be left unattended to .\n",
      "S Today , even as many other countries have taken small steps towards the control of greenhouse emissions , the fact remains that a large portion of the energy we generate for human consumption still comes from the burning of fossil fuels .\n",
      "S There is therefore a need for a more environmentally friendly way to generate the energy for our use .\n",
      "S The development of a problem statement gives the engineer a chance to look into the elements which the need is comprised of .\n",
      "S In this case , to reduce the undesirable emissions of mainly carbon dioxide , sulphur dioxide and the oxides of nitrogen in order to provide environmentally friendlier energy .\n",
      "S With the aid of a clear problem statement , the engineer is able to tackle the problem at its core by following through with an objective-specific statement .\n",
      "S The act of gathering information pertaining to the problem enables the engineer to look into possible past solutions to examine their effectiveness in dealing with the situation .\n",
      "S As previously mentioned , the Kyoto Protocol binds the countries in agreement to achieve approximately 5 to 10 percent reduction in greenhouse emissions .\n",
      "S Noting the episode when the United States opted out citing the potential costs towards their economy , the engineer bears in mind that the social acceptance of his system is largely shaped by the final economic cost or gain by its users .\n",
      "S Next in line with the design process is to brainstorm for solutions and list all of them out for later comparison .\n",
      "S For the need of environmentally friendly energy generated , the possible solutions are , though not limited to , alternate sources of energy and increased efficiency of fuel to energy conversion in conventional fossil fuel power generators .\n",
      "S In the last step of our discussion , the analysis and therefore selection of a single solution for adaptation , falls back heavily upon previous research .\n",
      "S The engineer must be mindful of various factors and make a choice towards one solution which balances the criterion he deems necessary for his product to meet the need .\n",
      "S I defined the more important requirements of the final solution to be its ease of acceptance by users , the extent of reduction of undesirable emissions and the time taken for implementation and effect .\n",
      "S Comparing the two solutions , alternate sources of energy like wind energy , hydroelectric energy or nuclear energy significantly reduces the amount of greenhouse gas produced .\n",
      "S However , it is not likely that they will be able to replace the current infrastructures of fossil fuel generators at a quick rate due to high start-up costs , and in some cases geographical constraints .\n",
      "S Hence , despite being an ideal solution in the long run , alternate energy sources are unable to curb the problem now .\n",
      "S On the other hand , increasing efficiency of current generators allow for optimisation tune-ups , which are less costly and more likely to be welcomed and readily adopted by the energy business .\n",
      "S Furthermore , there is much room for improvements in fuel to energy efficiency ; with innovation towards developing upgrades for conventional generators to better utilise the usual energy lost as heat , the amount of fuel needed and therefore greenhouse gas emissions could see a decrease of upwards of 20 percent .\n",
      "S The solution to the need of an environmentally friendlier way to generate energy based on my particular set of factors is therefore to innovate for an add-on to existing power generators to provide greater efficiency of fuel to energy conversion .\n",
      "S This will reduce the greenhouse emissions as smaller amounts of fuel would be needed to generate the same amount of energy , thus meeting our need .\n",
      "S The ubiquitous gasoline cars we have around the world nowadays are being slowly replaced by the electric-powered cars .\n",
      "S In fact , U.S President Barack Obama is aiming to put a million electric vehicles on the roads by 2015 ( Peter , 2009 ) and with the world 's number one superpower taking the lead , it is almost as sure that the rest of the world will jump on the bandwagon .\n",
      "S These battery-powered cars were previously a costly mode of transport limited to a niche market but they have since been reborn and are creating a new wave in the automobile market .\n",
      "S The rebirth of the electric vehicle technology can be attributed to the revived interest by the automobile giants , government regulations on greenhouse gas emission and also the improvement in the technicalities previously assosciated with electric cars .\n",
      "S This year , the US Department of Energy , after a highly competitive application process , handed out US $ 400 million in grants to the 'Big Three ' - Chrysler , Ford and General Motors to develop next-generation technologies for electric vehicles ( Elie , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S The vote of trust as shown by the Big Three 's initiative in developing this technology has provided a huge boost to the viability of electric cars replacing gasoline vehicles as the main mode of transport on the roads .\n",
      "S Together with the strong backing of the government , it is exactly the type of stimulus that the electric vehicles require in order to make a strong and sustained headway into the automobile industry .\n",
      "S US President Obama is expected to sign an order next month for federal agencies to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 ( Tim , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This is also reflected on a global scale , with major economies such as Russia , United Kingdom and China pledging to reduce their greenhouse gas emission within a similar time frame through carbon emission regulations and guidelines .\n",
      "S Switching from gasoline vehicles to the 'zero-emission ' electric vehicles will significantly reduce the carbon emission of these countries , hence the resurgence of electric vehicles and their technology .\n",
      "S Previously , electric vehicles were plagued with numerous technical problems and simply did not appeal to car owners .\n",
      "S Major problems included long charging time of up to hours and the lack of charging facilities However , improvement in the charging technology promises to reduce charging time to between 10 and 45 minutes .\n",
      "S In addition , studies say that as much as $ 320 million will be spent on charging infrastructure over the next 20 years ( Peter , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Certainly , with more than one million electric cars on the road , charging infrastructure has to be developed and proliferated to meet the surge in demand for charging points .\n",
      "S The global push towards the adoption of the electric vehicle technology is increasing in tempo .\n",
      "S However , for it to replace the gasoline vehicles will be an uphill task that requires a concerted effort from both the industry and governments .\n",
      "S Hybrid vehicles available on the roads nowadays are a good start , and hopefully in years to come , gasoline cars will be a thing of the past .\n",
      "S According to Rogers , E. M. ( 2003 ) , development of engineering design process consists of a total six main stages namely , needs/problems , research ( basic and applied ) , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and consequences respectively.1 The whole design process of creating new products is tedious and will take very long time to complete the research process , and then to the development stage .\n",
      "S Due to the limited resources in Singapore , the commercialization stage may not be able to execute .\n",
      "S In this manner , most of the development of engineering design process carried out in Singapore end at the development stage .\n",
      "S Examples of two such projects are \" NUS Eco-car''2 and \" NUS Haptic Chair''.3\n",
      "S In Singapore , moving on to the commercialization stage of the design process is not easily achieved without going through tough brain storming .\n",
      "S There are many factors to consider in order for decisions to be made .\n",
      "S Thus , problems ( may ) arise and hinder the commercialization stage of the design process .\n",
      "S First of all , for the NUS eco-car innovation process , it is true that the development of eco-car is indeed environmental friendly .\n",
      "S It does save the Earth with its advanced technology of bringing upon \" green \" effects , which will be welcomed by everyone .\n",
      "S However , if eco-car is to proceed on with the commercialization stage in the engineering design process , the problem encountered by my home country is the capital cost .\n",
      "S This is because most of the parts contributed to the assembly of the eco car are bought from overseas and these better grade materials can be rare source and hard to acquire .\n",
      "S Furthermore , hiring skilled workers and buying machine to assemble car are costly as well .\n",
      "S Hence , for the eco-car to be launched in Singapore in its commercialization stage of the design process , the production of car will result in significantly increased in cost of retail price due to the high prices of raw materials in constructing of car .\n",
      "S The high retail price of car will significantly affect the decision of committee to commercialize the product as consumer would not pay much for it .\n",
      "S On the other hand , for the NUS Haptic Chair innovation process , the researchers had successfully developed the chair for the convenience of the deaf people in Singapore .\n",
      "S The problem that hampers the design process is the shortage of testers to test on the product , for which according to the article3 that there were not enough deaf children in Singapore to test this product .\n",

      "S Based on E.M. Roger 's paper on \" Generation of innovation \" , a typical engineering design process for innovations can be broken down into 6 main stages which is identifying the needs of the market , research process , development of the product , commercialization , diffusion and adoption and finally , consequences .\n",
      "S Out of the 6 stages , I will be elaborating about problems in the research and development stage with reference to examples that occurred in Singapore .\n",
      "S Research is no doubt one of the key factors that contribute to the success of an innovation .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the research sector is one of the best funded field , besides education and defense .\n",
      "S With a population of only about 4 million , coupled with lack of natural resources , Singapore has no choice but to make the most of what resources are available .\n",
      "S Hence the significance and importance of research in Singapore .\n",
      "S Examples of common problems in the research sector are lack of skilled labour , time constraint and budget .\n",
      "S Take the NUS eco-car project for example which was engineered by NUS and still in the research stage .\n",
      "S It is not fully developed and commercialized yet because of its low market value .\n",
      "S To build an effective eco-car , a pool of skilled labour is needed .\n",
      "S However , in NUS , the project is of student level only .\n",
      "S With additional guidance from experienced engineers , the eco- car could have been better designed at probably have a better chance to be marketed .\n",
      "S The lack of skilled labour in the project caused it to be somewhat stuck at the research stage of the innovation process .\n",
      "S Hence the development of the eco-car was not consumer friendly and it was unable to move on to the commercialization stage .\n",
      "S Maybe it would be take a few more years before the eco-car have a potential to be marketed .\n",
      "S Sometimes , in the innovation process , problems may also occur during the development stage .\n",
      "S Take the NUS FSAE race car project for example .\n",
      "S After all the research being done , through software rendering and such , the problems starts when trying to develop it .\n",
      "S After all , the simulation done on computers can not be compared to what the students experienced .\n",
      "S In real life , the theories and graphical models formulated on computers can not be fully achieved and this is a common problem in most engineering innovations .\n",
      "S For this NUS FSAE race car , the innovation stops at the development stage as this is a NUS student project .\n",
      "S It will not be taken to the market level .\n",
      "S The success of the design will be based on the yearly race competition held on an international level .\n",
      "S To sum up , lack of skilled labour and inability to re-create computer simulation in real life are not the only 2 problems commonly faced in engineering design process in Singapore .\n",
      "S However , these 2 problems are enough to cause the downfall and failure of the product when placed in the market .\n",
      "S Engineering design processes consists of five different stages starting with defining the problem , followed by gathering pertinent information , generating multiple solutions , analyzing and selecting a solution and finally testing and implementing the solutions .\n",
      "S When solving a design problem , one may encounter problems that will hamper the design process .\n",
      "S In engineering design processes , two of the problems that will hamper the design process would be the lack of funds and resources .\n",
      "S Fund is an important factor that determines whether the design process can be carry on or otherwise .\n",
      "S To begin with the design process , there is a need to have a team of experts and researchers to sphere head the project which requires hiring cost .\n",
      "S Therefore , the lack of fund will result in the inability to hire professionals to accomplish the task .\n",
      "S Fund also plays an important role in purchasing materials to manufacture the product .\n",
      "S Most of the time , products are made over and over again to improve its weaknesses and strengthen its strengths .\n",
      "S Therefore , purchasing of materials can be quite costly as plenty of them will go to waste .\n",
      "S As a result , the lack of fund will hamper the progress of the design process as there is no material to manufacture a physical product to test its usefulness .\n",
      "S The design process does not stop after coming out with a final product .\n",
      "S This is because the product may not be perfect , and minor yet important changes need to be done to improve the product .\n",
      "S Therefore , further research needs to be done and money will be involved .\n",
      "S Without sufficient funds , research to further improve the product can not be done and this may hamper the design process .\n",
      "S Another main problem that will hamper the engineering design process will be the lack of resources in terms of knowledge , raw material and technology .\n",
      "S Knowledge is very important in engineering design processes .\n",
      "S Without knowledge , one will not be able to make wise decisions during the design process .\n",
      "S For example in the aero plane design process , one needs to determine the material to be use as the body of the aircraft .\n",
      "S Without the knowledge of the characteristics of different materials , one will not be able to choose the best material , which must be strong yet light in weight , to be use .\n"

      "S To illustrate it simply , one current need of modern people is the demand for a consistent energy source .\n",
      "S Therefore , engineering design process aims to invent a technology approach to meet people 's need .\n",
      "S By identifying the problem and listing all the possible resolutions , it will figure out the best energy source and try to utilize it to supply energy .\n",
      "S After that , gradual improvements will make it more practical , which subsequently serve the public better .\n",
      "S It is known that we all live in a new era where every social activity or industry production activity we do is closely relevant to energy utilization .\n",
      "S Sometimes when the electricity power is cut off temporarily , or the price of petrol is raised rapidly , we will find that our lives are severely affected .\n",
      "S Hence , demand for effective energy supply is the major need of modern people .\n",
      "S A successful engineering design processes should start with the correct identification of the problem .\n",
      "S The main energy source nowadays is fossil fuel energy which has limited storage in the earth .\n",
      "S In 10 years time , the supply of oil and gas will fail to meet people 's need .\n",
      "S ( World 's oil will run out in ten years .\n",
      "S ) To avoid the predicted energy crisis happening , engineers are expected to find a new energy source which is sustainable .\n",
      "S The following step is to consider all possible new energy supply source and selecting the best one .\n",
      "S According to reliable research , the new energy supplies include nuclear energy , solar energy , and geothermal energy ( Wikipedia ) .\n",
      "S Their advantage mainly embodies in respect that they are all renewable energy source .\n",
      "S Among them , solar energy is the best choice because it is safer than nuclear energy and easier to be obtained than geothermal energy .\n",
      "S Hence , solar energy comes into our sights as an ideal energy source .\n",
      "S After that , engineering design process applies the engineering theorem and latest technology to practice , which amounts to effectively use solar energy .\n",
      "S For example , solar energy can be used to heat the bath water .\n",
      "S The whole process is like installing a solar penal containing many tubes on the roof of the house where the penal can be maximally exposes to the sunlight .\n",
      "S Then let the bath water flows through the tubes and absorbs the heat collected by the tubes .\n",
      "S Through heat transfer from tube to the water , bath water is heated .\n",
      "S Another application of solar energy is relevant to the energy generation .\n",
      "S Wind and falling water are actually different forms of solar energy ( Harnessing direct solar energy a progress report , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S By releasing the energy stored in them , large amount of electricity is generated which can solve the electricity shortage in some regions of the world and give great support to the normal living and production activities .\n",
      "S Last but not least , the engineering design process still needs gradual improvements to truly meet people 's need .\n",
      "S The production cost of solar energy is higher than that of fossil fuel energy , which therefore impedes its popularization .\n",
      "S Hence , how to cut the cost is what engineering designer should consider about in the future , in order to let solar energy be utilized more successfully .\n",

      "S When you are enjoying ice-cream in a sweltering summer , have you ever thought about that you are enjoying the privilege for rich people roughly 100 years ago ?\n",
      "S For your information , refrigerator is a rather new invention , and it is not widely used among common household until 1930s ( Bowden & Offer , 1994 ) .\n",
      "S Then how does refrigerator come into being ?\n",
      "S Some factors such as the demand of lead user , economic factors , and environmental concern actually play important roles in shaping refrigerator into its shape today .\n",
      "S In the first place , the lead user of refrigerator is the first and most important factor that drives the development of refrigerator .\n",
      "S Lead user can be defined as a group of people that have the greatest need towards a potential invention .\n",
      "S According to Hippel ( cited by Rogers , 2003 ) , lead user plays an important role in most of the innovation-designing process , because they usually have the needs of innovations that are \" well ahead of the general market \" .\n",
      "S In the case of refrigerator , lead user can be regarded as the food businessmen in 20th century , mainly because most food would perish very fast under normal temperature .\n",
      "S In addition , long distance transportation of food also requires low temperature to preserve the food .\n",
      "S Since the lead user has such a great need on a product that could help them keep the food cool easily , refrigerator was first commercially introduced to long distance food transportation in 1900s ( Bowden & Offer , 1994 ) .\n",
      "S Lead user therefore started the application of refrigerator on business .\n",
      "S Beside the factor of lead user , which we can consider as people 's demand , the economic factor is also an important part that shapes the refrigerator .\n",
      "S One of the evidence of this is that the use of refrigerator was only being widespread after its price drops to a level that could be accepted by the norms .\n",
      "S The refrigerator is influenced by the values of the norms here .\n",
      "S Another evidence of this among the development of refrigerator is the domination of electric refrigerator .\n",
      "S Before the release of refrigerator into the large potential market of common household , there is an ideal substitute for electric refrigerator gas refrigerator , which has a quieter operation and longer use duration ( Cowan , cited by Roger , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S The reason why all of us now are using the \" huming \" electric refrigerator instead of the gas one is that the corporations decided the electric refrigerator would bring them larger profit , and therefore they went all out to promote the electric refrigerator .\n",
      "S So the refrigerator is shaped by the potential profitability of its producer in this way .\n",
      "S Both the values of the norms and the profitability of the producer can be classified as economic factors .\n",
      "S Last but not least , the environmental concern also helps to shape the refrigerator during its innovation-development process .\n",
      "S For example , one of the reasons why refrigerator was not widely used by common household before 1930s is because the refrigerator at that time was using toxic-gas system , which would destroy the environment and be unsafe for home use .\n",
      "S What is more , the environmental concern has become more and more important in the development of refrigerator in the past decades .\n",
      "S One of the most popular refrigerants for refrigerator , Tetrafluoroethane , has been banned by the governments in a lot of countries , taking its depletion to the ozone layer into concern .\n",
      "S The environmental concern therefore leads the refrigerator develop in a more environmental-friendly direction .\n",
      "S In conclusion , in its innovation-development process , refrigerator is mainly shaped by the demand of food businessmen , as well as the economic factors and environmental concern .\n",
      "S Due to the number of words limited , this essay only scratches the surface of what leads to the invention and diffusion of the refrigerator , and picks out the three most obvious factors to discuss .\n",

      "S As the global economy continues its search for growth , its insatiable appetite for energy has greatly diminished our non-renewable resources .\n",
      "S Scientists have estimated that given the current global energy consumption , we only have sufficient oil reserves to last us for another 50 years .\n",
      "S Furthermore , greenhouse emissions produced from the burning of fossil fuels have lead to global warming , with its impact visible from the shrinkage of polar ice caps at the Arctic region as well as the rise in global temperature .\n",
      "S This could eventually cause flooding of low lying areas as well as food shortages and it paints a bleak picture for our future generation .\n",
      "S Therefore , the world is turning its head towards 'green ' technology as a solution to the above crisis .\n",
      "S Research on the 'green ' technology field has started way back in early 1950s , however it has only started to gain momentum recently as its economic and social benefits become more recognised .\n",
      "S With oil prices steadily climbing towards US $ 100 per barrel , business cost also rises with rising energy cost .\n",
      "S This would lead to price inflation and could cause an economic slowdown as affordability would be a concern .\n",
      "S Furthermore , if no other alternative energy sources are discovered , we could face severe economic problems when we eventually run out of oil , since we need energy to run our economy .\n",
      "S Investing in 'green ' technology would not only ensure that we will have a steady supply of energy to develop our economy but it could also be another source of revenue for countries developing such technologies and some analysts has estimated that this industry could potentially be worth up to US $ 4 trillion .\n",
      "S Therefore , governments are pouring funds into research on this field to benefit from its economic advantages .\n",
      "S Next , there is a general consensus that global warming has been greatly attributed by the rise of greenhouse emission from the burning of fossil fuels , which could have devastating and irreversible impacts .\n",
      "S Recently , rising temperature has been causing frequent heat waves across Europe which has killed a number of people .\n",
      "S The rising temperature also gave rise to an increase in the number of heat stroke cases and could cause a potential health issue .\n",
      "S Furthermore , rising temperature also resulted in frequent droughts which caused food shortages and aggravate the world 'hunger ' problem .\n",
      "S More significantly , the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers could endanger low lying areas and the rise in temperature could also cause severe imbalances in our delicate ecosystem .\n",
      "S This will impact all walks of life , including us , humans .\n",
      "S The world environmental system is now balanced on a crucial tipping point beyond which costly , devastating and irreversible impacts will be inevitable .\n",
      "S Therefore , the future of our planet lies in our hands and we must be socially responsible for our future generation .\n",
      "S Thus , environmental groups have been pressuring businesses and governments for 'green ' energy solutions as we thread our economic progress with sustainability .\n",
      "S On top of that , governments have also been pushing for the 'green ' agenda .\n",
      "S This is evident from the carbon tax law that has been imposed by European Union on businesses , which tax businesses on the amount of carbon they produced .\n",
      "S Furthermore , government are also awarding incentives for companies to go 'green ' and more research funds have been allocated to this new field to develop 'green ' products .\n",
      "S This is evident from President Obama 's economic plan , which includes a US $ 1 trillion package invested into the 'green ' industry so that 'greener ' products can be developed to ensure economic sustainability .\n",
      "S 'Green ' technology maybe the main focus in this century , however it must be noted that investing in this technology is costly and not many businesses are willing to venture into it on its own .\n",
      "S Therefore , scientists , businessmen and governments must work together to find a feasible solution in balancing economic growth with sustainability .\n",
      "S In the age of information technology and globalization , the world we live today have progressed beyond our imagination by the aid of constant improvement in technology by research and development ( R&D ) as well as innovation .\n",
      "S In one of the Rogers 's article in 'Diffusion of Innovations ' ( 2003 ) , he has mentioned about the introduction of battery technology in the electric vehicle by General Motors ( GM ) in the early 1990s .\n",

      "S Issues pertaining to environmental degradation have already begun to dominate discussions among the world leaders as well as the general population since the early 1990s .\n",
      "S As mentioned by Rogers ( 2003 ) , environmental factor is one of the primary issues that led to the production of the electric cars .\n",
      "S Electric cars were created to eradicate the ramifications caused by emissions of carbon dioxide and the smog level in the world .\n",
      "S According to Tyler ( 2009 ) , the Ontario Medical Association announced that smog is responsible for an estimated 9,500 premature deaths in the province each year .\n",
      "S Hence , it will be beneficial for the creation of the electric cars in the hope of reducing the number of deaths caused by smog .\n",
      "S Furthermore , leaded petrol has been commonly used by the cars consumers in the past .\n",
      "S Depending on the methods used for generating of electricity in electric cars , they have the capability of producing very low emission of carbon dioxide .\n",
      "S It will be possible when more nature energy such as wind and water is used to generate electricity by the turbines compared to the burning of fossil fuels by the power plants .\n",

      "S In Singapore , our small population and education system are two of the main reasons for delays in the process .\n",
      "S Singapore is the smallest nation in Southeast Asia , covering just over 270 square miles and with a population of roughly 4.7million .\n",
      "S As compared with other innovation powerhouses , for example Japan ; which has about 128 million people , Singapore has a very small population .\n",
      "S This lead to factors such as , a limited pool of local talents , a small local market and a lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations ; all of which will affect the engineering design process .\n",
      "S Researching and developing a new product requires a dedicated team of talented researchers with different expertises .\n",
      "S Therefore , in Singapore , it is often difficult to gather such a team due to our small population , which means a smaller group of local talents .\n",
      "S As a result , smaller teams are formed and it inevitably increases the time spent on the whole process .\n",
      "S Furthermore , there could also be a lack of design ideas .\n",
      "S The Singapore government is well aware of this problem and has been trying to attract foreign talents to fill the void .\n",
      "S According to Khandani ( 2005 ) , \" The net result or purpose of most engineering designs is to produce a product that generates a profit for the company .\n",
      "S \" Thus , if there is only a small local market to sell the product , a lot of extra effort will have to be placed to ensure that the final product sells .\n",
      "S The engineering design process will be further delayed because of this extra effort required .\n",
      "S The final effect of having a small population in Singapore is the lack of volunteers willing to try out new innovations .\n",
      "S This is further pointed out in the case of the Haptic Chair ( Chua 2009 ) developed by Suranga Nanayakkara , a PhD student from National University of Singapore .\n",
      "S Mr Nanayakkara had to bring the Haptic Chair back to Sri Lanka for testing because he could not get access to enough deaf children in Singapore .\n",
      "S The lack of testers in Singapore will hamper the fifth step of the engineering design process stated by Khandani , which is the testing and implementation of the solution .\n",

      "S As a result , there is usually lack of creativity in the students produced through this system .\n",
      "S The impact of having a lack of creativity during the engineering design process is severe as the process requires the generation of multiple solutions .\n",
      "S A workforce that is educated in Singapore will probably suffer as they are not used to answering design questions while they are studying .\n",
      "S Therefore , the process will most likely be hampered due to the lack of creativity in our workforce .\n",

      "S As to handle these storage problems , the related areas came out of two solutions .\n",
      "S One is to use full-scale high-pressure hydrogen tanks for vehicles .\n",
      "S Another is to use special materials for solid-state hydrogen storage .\n",
      "S On the one hand , to storage hydrogen under pressure is a rather well-known technique .\n",
      "S However , the use of hydrogen tanks in vehicles , and in particular the challenge of using very high pressures , require advanced technology .\n",
      "S It needs to overcome permeation problem and pass cycling tests .\n",
      "S On the other hand , for solid-state hydrogen storage , it requires materials that can absorb hydrogen quickly and massively .\n",
      "S Furthermore , there are also certain requirements for their reaction .\n",
      "S Overall , these two solutions have their own advantages in different aspects ; at the same time , they also have difficulties respectively .\n",
      "S So as to make these two hydrogen storage schemes feasible , a lot of experiments and tests have been done .\n",
      "S For the compressed hydrogen storage , many numerical modeling has been done through computational fluid dynamics tools .\n",

      "S And the experiment results came out as well .\n",
      "S For the cycling tests , the filling time is less than 3 minutes and the maximum pressure is 350 bar ( will be increased to 700 bar in the near future ) .\n",

      "S Technology is the design or creation of an instrument or an action that lowers the uncertainty in the relationship of cause-effect in achieving a desired outcome .\n",

      "S Technological innovations created from scientific researching are created to satisfy a need of to solve a problem affecting people .\n",
      "S Serendipitously created innovations are actually spin-offs from the original plan of research .\n",

      "S Although they had very different outcome , they were triggered by the same motivation to make a better world .\n",
      "S Birth of these two types of innovations had very similar causes , such as pressure from the society or government to cater to certain needs .\n",
      "S Two pieces of technology , for instance , eco-cars and warfarin were products of research and serendipity respectively .\n",
      "S The creation of eco-cars was to address to environmental issues such as global warming and air pollution .\n",
      "S In the early 1990s , the California and Arizona state government demanded that at least ten percent of the total sales of automobile would have to be environmentally friendly .\n",
      "S This resulted in an automobile giant , General Motors ( GM ) , dedicating $ 2billion into producing electric cars .\n",
      "S ( E.M.Rogers , 2003 ) This is a case where an innovation is created to cater to the needs by scientific research .\n",
      "S Similarly , the creation of warfarin , the most widely used rat poison in the world , was initially motivated by the pressure from the society to find out what caused the mysterious deaths of cattle .\n",
      "S In the 1930s , farmers fed their cattle with sweet clover hay but cattle were dying from internal bleeding caused by it .\n",
      "S Through further research , Professor K.P.Link found that the sweet clover hay contained a harmful chemical called coumarin which turned out to be a very effective rat killer , thus warfarin was born .\n",
      "S ( E.M.Rogers , 2003 ) This type of unexpected innovation is called serendipity .\n",
      "S Innovations , regardless serendipity or not , have a common motivation which is to solve surfacing problems in the world .\n",
      "S Electric cars and warfarin alike , they need to be marketed and diffused for potential users to adapt .\n",
      "S Electric cars were marketed extensively through a word-of-mouth process ( E.M.Rogers , 2003 ) arousing a great interest in electric cars .\n",
      "S Also , warfarin was liscenced by Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation ( WARF ) to commercial manufacturer and then used by farmers to eradicate rats where its effectiveness is readily observed .\n",
      "S Both these innovations need to be well marketed and diffused before it can actually solve any problems .\n",
      "S However , the fate of dedicated researched innovations and serendipitous innovations can differ greatly .\n",
      "S One can be almost certain that a serendipitous product will be put into use without much delay as this product is often discovered by another needy party to solve their problems in the process of the initial research .\n",
      "S On the other hand , products through dedicated researching were monitored by a parent organization .\n",
      "S For example , further development of electric cars was dismissed due to the shift of taste of the market towards the \" hybrid \" gas- and-electric-powered vehicles .\n",
      "S If this product does not provide a satisfactory amount of benefits to the parent organization , it may be dismissed despite its potential usefulness .\n",
      "S In conclusion , innovations are to make life of its user to improve .\n",
      "S No matter how the innovations come about , they have a common sense of motivation .\n",
      "S Through investigation of needs and problems , innovations are made accordingly but unexpected discovery of ideas will lead to innovations of a different kind .\n",
      "S These different kinds will face different circumstances thus a different fate .\n",
      "S Innovations however profitable should not be dismissed but sell to a higher platform where it could spark other ideas or satisfy needs that are not foreseen by the parent organization .\n",
      "S Technology has played a significant role in moulding our lives .\n",
      "S As long as we seek to improve our lives , technology will always exist .\n",
      "S However , this is a period of time where technology will be important in helping mankind to survive on this planet .\n",
      "S Global warming has been identified as one of the greatest threat to our survival , and engineers have tried to solve this issue by coming up with green technology such as solar panels , windmills and dams .\n",
      "S This is a case of technology being socially determined , but modifications in the form of economic factors , military demands and government regulations have occurred , which prevents this technology from being utilised fully .\n",
      "S One of the top priorities of every country on this planet is to ensure the stability of their economy .\n",
      "S For that matter , the use of green technology is not feasible in every country .\n",
      "S Take for example , a country like Singapore , where there are no natural resources available and land-space constraints are always a problem .\n",
      "S Imagine using solar panels to provide electricity for every household .\n",
      "S Given the fact that most households in Singapore share a common block , if the solar panels are fixed on the top of the buildings , will there be enough to provide sufficient electricity for the whole block , which may consists of up to eighty household users .\n",
      "S Given the land constraints , it is definitely a costly as well as non-feasible innovation and only time will tell if this technology can be upgraded into something that can be fitted into a society like Singapore .\n",
      "S Economic factors and government regulations are closely related .\n",
      "S Based on the Madrid article , ( Madrid ( 1995 ) Diagnosing climate change ) John Houghton joked with the leader of Saudi Arabia 's delegate party that what he was proposing was against his country 's interest , and that he should not be raising it instead .\n",
      "S As we all know , Saudi Arabia 's source of income is mainly from the oil industry .\n",
      "S If households all over the world started converting to green technology , there will be a decrease in demand for fuel ( since it runs the electricity needed for each household ) and as a result a decrease in their countries economy .\n",
      "S This is a case where a country is willing to put aside government priorities for the greater issue on hand , by supporting the use of green technology .\n",
      "S Let us now take a look at the military demands which plays a part in shaping this technological innovation as well .\n",
      "S Tanks are built with the intent to destroy and provide artillery support during a war .\n",
      "S One way to reduce fuel consumption is to modify tanks such that they all have built-in solar panels , as long as the war is fought in the day , then it should be fine ; realistic ?\n",
      "S It is because of the military demands that require tanks to be available at all times , and that it is able to withstand mild firepower , which is why any additional cost required for the solar panels will be put to better use by increasing the tank solidity .\n",
      "S In a bid to counter the issue of global warming , solutions that are socially determined such as solar panels , windmills and dams were created .\n",
      "S Yet the use of it has been restricted by economic factors , military demands as well as government regulations .\n",
      "S Should the day arrive when innovations can be clear of such restriction , only then will the full benefits of it be felt .\n",
      "S In the recent few decades , adverse climate changes and increase numbers of natural disasters have finally made humans realize the impact of human activities on earth .\n",
      "S This ignited a chain of campaigns , activist groups and policies in support of reducing pollutions and wastes to save our planet .\n",
      "S This current situation may seems favorable theoretically for innovations such as the electric car industries to flourish .\n",
      "S However , in reality , the development process of environmental friendly electric cars depends mainly on government policies , social acceptance and cooperation with other related industries .\n",
      "S Decisions made by any industries or citizens in a country is heavily influenced by the policies made by the government .\n",
      "S In the early 1990 , the support given by the California and Arizona state governments on electric cars manages to boost sales of electric cars made by General Motors ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Besides giving financial aid to R&D departments which helps to initiate the start of the project on electric cars , subsides and incentive may also be given to citizens who use electric cars which would increase the demand for more electric cars .\n",
      "S Such increase in demand would result in companies to increase the supply of electric cars and probably trigger new companies to enter the electric car market .\n",
      "S Thus this increases the rate of development in electric cars .\n",
      "S In conjunction with incentives for electric cars , taxes on pollution inducing cars can also be increased which will motivate people to choose electric cars over petrol cars .\n",
      "S These factors induced by governments decisions truly showed the instigation it has on industries and consumers alike .\n",
      "S Besides government influence , the survival of a new technology also depends on social acceptance of the new product .\n",
      "S In the case of the IMPACT electric cars , the opinion leaders were the ones who stimulated the sales and awareness of these cars ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Many scientific articles also states that social acceptance is increasingly being recognized as a constraining factor in innovations based on renewable energy sources ( Rolf , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S Without the accession from the society , it would be difficult for the emergent of any new innovations .\n",
      "S This is one of the reasons why marketing strategies such as the use of promotions and advertisements is extremely important in rising the awareness and creating a need for new technologies , thus allowing a new technology to survive .\n",
      "S On the contrary , cooperation between other industries can be equally as important .\n",
      "S For example , if no power supply company is willing to build charging stations for electric cars , it would be impossible for electric cars to exist .\n",
      "S Similarly , if all current gas stations are installed with fast battery charging equipment , electric cars would be more practical and be allowed to travel freely .\n",
      "S Besides the need for electric car companies to work well with their power suppliers , it would be practical for them to work hand in hand with banks and insurance sectors .\n",
      "S An attractive loan and insurance scheme is substantial as it will allow potential customers to buy an electric car , which can have a hefty price tag .\n",
      "S These examples clearly show the significance of the benefits that cooperation between related industries can have on an emerging technology like the electric car .\n",
      "S Ultimately , it is clearly shown to us that there are many factors that can deduce the rate of development of the electric car .\n",
      "S It is thus important for innovators to gain their government 's support , get socially accepted and collaborate well with different industries .\n",
      "S In order for electric cars to substitute the current petrol cars , much more have to be done in the mentioned three aspects .\n",
      "S If these factors are not fulfilled , electric cars would still probably ends up as a failed dream .\n",

      "S Some examples will be the physical , financial and emotional damage from an event .\n",
      "S The design process comprises the process of defining problems , generating solutions and selecting analyzed solutions , which helps in meeting the need of safety in technology .\n",

      "S Then , existing solutions to the problems are assessed and combined with other possible solutions to produce better solutions .\n",
      "S This process of tearing and combining is called synthesis .\n",

      "S After we entering the 21st century , our society has come into a new stage with higher productivity and efficiency , which also means that we have more energy requirement at the same time .\n",
      "S For centuries , our major energy came from burning the fossil fuel such as coal , oil and gas .\n",
      "S They have higher quantity of combustion , but they are not reproducible and the resource is limited .\n",

      "S On sunny day , we have the sun-light , how about rainy or cloudy day ?\n",
      "S As a result , scientists choose another generation of resource----nuclear power .\n",
      "S It is powerful and it can be under our control to produce energy continuously .\n",
      "S The final step is to test whether the solution is executable .\n",
      "S After few years test , nuclear power plants work quite well .\n",
      "S In 2008 , there are more than 400 nuclear power plants are in operation , take of about 10 % of our energy load .\n",
      "S In recent years , we use uranium as nuclear plant fuel ; the problem is it gives off harmful radiations .\n",
      "S Instead engineers think of another method , use nucleosynthesis , the fuel of nucleosynthesis reaction is just a particular kind of water get from the sea .\n",
      "S This test is still under the experimentation , because of the rigorous reaction condition .\n",
      "S In conclusion , engineering process is significant for us .\n",
      "S It applies in our daily life , give more solutions to a same problem .\n",
      "S It supports the society to move faster .\n",
      "S Over the years , we have seen many new technological innovations and inventions .\n",
      "S Some are deem beneficial to mankind , which others are just created for the sake of businessman to reap in business profits .\n",
      "S However , this technological innovation which I am describing has brought about a large change in human life .\n",
      "S It has also brought about much convenience and is now consider an asset to most people .\n",
      "S The technological innovation which I am referring to is the introduction of 3G mobile phones .\n",
      "S In the early 1990s,mobile phones were first introduced to replace pagers .\n",
      "S Back then , mobile phones could only serve 1 basic function , and that was just to make basic phone calls .\n",
      "S There was no other functions in a mobile phone .\n",
      "S Apart from being a device with minimal functions , the design and shape of the mobile phone back then was also very ugly .\n",
      "S It was because at that time , the technology was not yet advance enough for manufacturers to come up with cool and sleek designs like the mobile phones nowadays .\n"

      "S It was also very costly to own one .\n",
      "S Hence , not many people were able to afford a mobile phone in the past .\n",
      "S However , take a look at today 's society .\n",
      "S Mobile phones have already become a necessity .\n",
      "S Almost everyone owns a mobile phone , including a certain percentage of primary school students .\n",
      "S The phones which people nowadays possess also differs from the past , in terms of functions , design and size .\n",
      "S All these transformation are brought about due to several factors .\n",
      "S Firstly , the manufacturers of the modern day mobile phones recognized and acknowledged the problem of phones in the past .\n",
      "S As quoted by E.M ROGERS in \" THE GENERATION OF INNOVATIONS \" : \" The innovation-development process often begins with recognition of a problem or need .\n",
      "S \" .\n",
      "S Manufacturers of mobile phones have found out the disadvantages and hassles of the mobile phones in the past .\n",
      "S As stated earlier , mobile phones back then had no other functions except for making phone calls .\n",
      "S Hence , if people back then require the services of surfing the internet or sending of mail , they had to rely upon other device such as the computer to do it .\n",
      "S Unlike the 3G mobile phones which is able to perform all these functions within it , mobile phones back then were really considered unproductive and inefficient .\n",
      "S Time is money .\n",
      "S Every sec wasted is equivalent to every cent lost .\n",
      "S Hence , in order to work in a more productive manner which saves time and bring about convenience for users , manufacturers today then come up with 3G phones which are equipped with internet , video-capturing device and an in-bulit music player which aims to provide entertainment to the users .\n",
      "S Secondly , this technological innovation was brought about by technical improvements in technology .\n",
      "S Over the years , we can see that technology is improving and more people are able to take advantage of it .\n",
      "S Hence , phone manufacturers decided to take a risk by adding a few new features into the mobile phone to see whether is it acceptable in the market .\n",
      "S A typical example is the production of NOKIA 8310 back then in 2002 .\n",
      "S This phone was the first phone in the industry to be equipped with radio function , apart from the basic functions of a phone .\n",
      "S After this production , many other rival brands follow suit .\n",
      "S This thus proves that the society is open and adaptable to new features in the phone .\n",
      "S This was further echoed by the good sales results of this model .\n",
      "S Hence , this thus send a signal to phone manufacturers---the public is more than willing to accept a phone with more functions and will not even mind to replace their previous models for newer ones with added features or functions .\n",
      "S As a result , it give manufacturers incentive to keep up with the times and to always constantly upgrade their mobile phones from point to point .\n",
      "S This is why we are able to see the presence/existence of the 3G mobile phones .\n",
      "S Economic factors also played an important role in this technological innovation .\n",
      "S Over the years , the production of parts for mobile phones has become cheaper .\n",
      "S This could be achieved as manufacturers are able to reap economics of scale as their production size increases .\n",
      "S Hence , as the cost is now lower , manufacturers are then more willing to produce and come up with more features to be added to the mobile phone to attract consumers to purchase it .\n",
      "S This is exactly the case for the production of 3G phones .\n",
      "S People find the 3G phone a useful device as it is able to perform many functions , which inevitably save time and bring about a lot of convenience .\n",
      "S As it has so many functions , it will definitely attract consumers to purchase it .\n",
      "S Since the demand for it is so high , manufacturers will then find it profitable to increase the supply .\n",
      "S This thus lead to the vast production of 3G phones , bringing technology to the next level .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the transformation of mobile phones from a black-grey screen to one that is so highly sophiscated is indeed something remarkable .\n",
      "S This technological innovation can not be achieved without the factors listed above .\n",
      "S I believe in the near future to come , we are able to expect more innovation and creativity being input in the production of mobile phones .\n",
      "S The society factors such as economic factors , political decision , and technological advancement advertising and even military demands can affects the development of technological innovation .\n",
      "S One very important technology that has been shaped by the society is the development of electric vehicle .\n",
      "S One of the factors that determined and shaped the technological innovation the most is the country economic status .\n",
      "S When people are richer , they will want to own something such as a car to show their social status .\n",
      "S Electric car in the past is very expensive and only the very wealthy people could afford it .\n",
      "S It is a display of social standing when you are seen in an electric car .\n",
      "S Therefore it is more common to see people in cars in those rich countries than those poor countries .\n",
      "S Political factors such as government decision and military demands could also shaped technological innovation .\n",
      "S Before world war one , the used of automobile were limited as there were very few roads .\n",
      "S During the war , there was mass construction of roads leading to suburbanization of the world making it more ideal to own an automobile .\n",
      "S However there was shortage of coal during the war thus making electric vehicle impractical to operate .\n",
      "S Therefore gasoline vehicle became more popular as government subsidized the building of gasoline vehicles to support their war .\n",
      "S After the war , gasoline vehicle became the preferred choice as it is more Development of technologies can be easily shaped and influenced by the group of users and the society .\n",
      "S commonly seen on the roads due to mass production during war .\n",
      "S Gasoline vehicle also seem more durable and electric vehicle more fragile .\n",
      "S After people attained a certain level of standards of living they became more concern about the environment .\n",
      "S They began to worry about the problem of pollution cause by gasoline vehicle .\n",
      "S Therefore government step in to ensure that for the total sales of automobile 10 percent must be nonpolluting , which meant that it has to be electric car or electric/gasoline cars .\n",
      "S Therefore people who are more environmentally friendly began to use electric vehicle again .\n",
      "S Technological advancement of a country also affects the development of the electric vehicle .\n",
      "S A very important component of the electric vehicle is the battery .\n",
      "S A very powerful battery is needed to powered and run the vehicle for a long time and it is only possible with advance battery technology .\n",
      "S It is only natural that nobody would want an electric car that needs recharging for every few miles it travel .\n",
      "S According to EM Roger ( 2003 ) , in the early 1990s , the battery technology can only support the vehicle to travels for 100miles .\n",
      "S For every 100 miles of travelling the vehicle requires 4 hours of recharging to a 220-volt outlet .\n",
      "S Before that the use of electric vehicle was very limited as the battery technology is not available or too costly .\n",
      "S There are many factors that may shape the technological innovation of the technology .\n",
      "S The factors may leave a positive or negative impact on the technological innovation depending on the market and how socially acceptable is the technology at that point of time .\n",
      "S Once such example of a technology that has been shape by it user would be the electric vehicle .\n",
      "S Therefore the society also plays an important role on technological innovation .\n",
      "S People nowadays do not only think of creating tools that can ease their life .\n",
      "S They also need to choose the most efficient technology that can meet their needs .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the processes to create and choose the suitable technology is called engineering design .\n",
      "S The engineering design recently has been implemented in a lot of Asia-Pacific countries , including Indonesia .\n",
      "S As a big country with huge amount of population , implementing a new aspect will not be done easily .\n",
      "S There are two main problems hampering engineering design ; consequently they are also affecting some stages of this process .\n",
      "S One of them is educational problem occurs in every level of academic institution in Indonesia .\n",
      "S The system is not designed to educate students to explore their creativity .\n",
      "S Students are being fed by materials given by the teacher and they are most likely not allowed to learn things in their own way .\n",
      "S For instance , elementary students must follow the step of solving mathematical problems given by the teacher ; otherwise they will not get the full score or even considered wrong .\n",
      "S This problem affects the solutions generating process in engineering design .\n",
      "S Since they only have one way to solve an obstacle , they will be fear of problems .\n",
      "S They will not take any risks to find another possibility for the solution of given obstacles .\n",
      "S Khandani ( 2005 ) stated that creative people are needed in this stage as they can observe details and in the same time , see the whole picture of the problem .\n",
      "S The second problem is limited amount of qualified human resources and fund .\n",
      "S In fact , there are a lot of potentials rise , but seldom is developed ; as a result , Indonesia is running out of qualified human resources .\n",
      "S Moreover , this country 's monetary is not in a proper condition ; indeed global crisis makes it even worse .\n",
      "S Thus , the condition of resources in Indonesia has many impacts in stages of engineering design .\n",
      "S The small amount of human resources ( HR ) impacts not only the technical stages , but also economic and market analysis stage .\n",
      "S As skilled engineer can hardly to be found , the technical problems of course will appear .\n",
      "S In addition , communities will not easily accept any new technology .\n",
      "S Their conservative thoughts will hamper the sale of product .\n",
      "S Many good inventions never get into production because the manufacturing costs exceed what people will pay for the product itself .\n",
      "S ( Khandani , 2005 ) Therefore , this problem will put the economic and market analysis stage in difficulties .\n",
      "S Based on Khandani ( 2005 ) , product safety is an important stage of engineering design , which assures that usage of the design , will not cause any injury to humans .\n",
      "S Khandani ( 2005 ) specified that the safety issue can extend to include property and environmental damage .\n",
      "S As we know , recently , there are a lot of fatal accidents have occurred in Indonesia ; for example , plane crash and collapsed railway .\n",
      "S Further investigation found out that they were caused by lack of safety and liability test .\n",
      "S They minimize this test because they do not have sufficient fund to support the test .\n",
      "S In brief , as Indonesia implements engineering design , it also faces two main problems .\n",
      "S They are educational and resources problem .\n",
      "S Consequently , these problems also impact the stages of engineering design , such as generate solutions , product safety and liability , technical , and economic analysis .\n",

      "S Living in a society with unprecedented material prosperity , human beings are facing severe problems resulted from energy and resource shortage right now .\n",
      "S In order to sustain a stable development in the next generations , people are paying more and more attention to build up an eco-friendly society which makes energy usage reach an optimum .\n",
      "S Considering the mass energy wastage in transit around the entire globe , one of the approaches to reduce energy usage is to construct a better transportation system that delivers energy more efficiently .\n",
      "S In engineering design processes , the steps regarding solution generation , selection and test are of vital importance to build up such an ideal energy transportation system .\n",
      "S Generating multiple solutions stimulates engineers ' creativity and provides impulsion to originate a technological breakthrough .\n",
      "S As Khandani ( 20005 ) mentioned in the article \" Engineering Design Process \" , it is required to investigate the existing solutions , utilize creativity to propose new methods and synthesise all the fresh and ready ideas to come up with a unique and valuable solution .\n",
      "S Such an approach enables engineers to think out of the bounder and challenge the old conventions , and subsequently forges innovative breakthroughs in fields , like transportation system construction , that have hardly experienced any remarkable advancement for decades .\n",
      "S Following the solution generation step , analyzing and selecting a design ensures that the ultimate solution suits best for implementation .\n",
      "S This crucial procedure places all related circumstances into consideration and evaluates the newly-born solutions using a systematic technique ( Khandani , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Being a project that is closely related to social economy and other critical issues , establishing an efficient energy transportation system urges engineers to identify the overall effectiveness of a certain solution based on the assessment in different fields .\n",
      "S The systematic evaluation approach applied in the engineering design process then facilitates engineers to generate a reliable judgement of the solutions to a large extent .\n",
      "S Lastly , the testing state places the final solution into a real-world practice for further improvement although restrictions exist .\n",
      "S This step allows the solution to be exposed to the real-world variation and yields an even more trustworthy appraisal .\n",
      "S It is also a moment for engineers to investigate the underlying problems in their design and then implement corresponding modification and improvement .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , simulating the real-world variation in accomplishing a huge project like constructing an efficient energy transportation system can not be fully comprehensive and creating a full-scale prototype of the system is even more unrealistic .\n",
      "S As a result , the effectiveness and some concealed weakness of the design are not able to be fully traced during the test .\n",
      "S To sum up , although imperfection in the accuracy of testing still exists , the solution generating , analyzing and testing steps in engineering design processes play key roles in forging innovative breakthroughs , verifying the feasibility of the design and upgrading the final solution while designing an effective energy transportation system .\n",
      "S Hopefully , the engineering design processes can be further polished in a short term so as to return engineering designs with higher quality .\n",

      "S GPSHow It Is Influenced Towards Commercialization\n",
      "S Throughout the history , many innovations were created not for its intended application .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , innovation process has six stages : needs/problem , research , development , commercialization , diffusion and adoption , and consequences .\n",
      "S The duration of the process takes many years , or even decades .\n",
      "S Political , social , economic changes during this period would affect the process of innovation .\n",
      "S One of such cases is Global Positioning System ( GPS ) .\n",
      "S It has evolved from its initial military purposes to the commercialized product that we know today .\n",
      "S Early United States government policy and cold war situation shaped the invention of GPS .\n",
      "S In 1960 , GPS was introduced by US Department of Defense to track down its marine .\n",
      "S Towards its development to today 's technology , the policy maker played an important part in it .\n",
      "S In 1973 , when the army , air force , and navy each had its navigation system , the department of defense once again came in and unified the technology .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in 1994 , as the cold war had ended , the US government then decided to fully open the GPS for public use .\n",
      "S The turning point for GPS for civilian use happened at 1983 , when a civilian Korean aircraft was shot down by the Soviet Union for territory trespassing .\n",
      "S It raised needs for a reliable navigation system .\n",
      "S Hence , driven by social concern , President Reagan of the US agreed to partially open the GPS for public use .\n",
      "S Soon after this , when the surveying market boomed in 1980s , the demand for GPS and the money generated also contributes to the development of GPS for civilian use .\n",
      "S Towards its development , GPS technology has few setbacks .\n",
      "S The most notable setback is at 1979 , when the economic situation in US was bad .\n",
      "S The US Department of Defense cut the development budget of GPS by 30 % .\n",
      "S As a result , the initial 24 satellites constellation was reduced to 18 .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the phase II ( Block II ) project was cancelled .\n",
      "S The development of advanced technology mainly was carried out by government agencies .\n",
      "S Hence , when the economic situation was bad , the government agencies would be affected .\n",
      "S The example also shows how economy and politics are interrelated in determining an innovation .\n",
      "S In conclusion , political , economic , and social situation normally determine an innovation as shown in GPS .\n",
      "S The GPS would not be possible to be commercialized had the situation was different .\n",
      "S The longer the duration of development , the greater will be the influence of the political , economic , and social situation on it .\n",
      "S Hence , the technology development is partly socially determined .\n",
      "S Problems Hampering Engineering Design Process for Innovations\n",
      "S As modern society is developing fast in the new century , human 's need becomes more and more diversified while problems of the shortage of resources get more and more serious .\n",
      "S Such kind of conflict requires engineers to develop new products to meet all needs .\n",
      "S The tasks are never easy for engineers without creativity and innovations ; engineers must design products which are both artistic and practical .\n",
      "S Designing products and finding solutions require a long term process , which is defined as engineering design process .\n",
      "S According to Khandani , engineering design process is a very important route for engineers to create products and it can be expressed as a 5-step process , which includes \" Define the problem \" , \" Gather pertinent information \" , \" Generate multiple solutions \" , \" Analyze and select a solution \" , and \" Test and implement the solution \" ( Khandani , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S However , there exist some problems that hamper engineering design processes for innovations .\n",
      "S Among them are the problem of plagiarism and the insufficiency of fund support for scientific research .\n",
      "S Plagiarism means using someone else 's words or ideas without citing sources ( Oshima &Hogue , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S The problem of plagiarism is fairly serious that a large number of university students do not do the academic work such as research reports and scientific essays on their own .\n",
      "S Many students just search sources on the Internet and submit their \" work \" perfunctorily , never to mention about the copyrights of the original researchers or writers .\n",
      "S Plagiarism is not only harmful for the original researchers or writers , but also an impediment for university students to gain creativity and innovative skills .\n",
      "S Plagiarism makes university students or even graduated researchers lazy to come up with their own ideas .\n",
      "S After they search out the information for their academic use , they simply follow the original train of thought and give up thinking about a different solution on their own .\n",
      "S Since doing as the experts do will receive a high mark while working on their own ideas may not , some students \" smartly \" choose to plagiarize .\n",
      "S However , such choice becomes harmful in the long run as the innovative skills of university students or researchers deteriorated .\n",
      "S Plagiarism significantly hinders the process of steps after gathering pertinent information in the engineering design process , which is about generating , analyzing , selecting , testing and implementing solutions .\n",
      "S For example , an engineering student who is doing a designing project do not have to analyze or select solutions , which is the fourth step in the engineering design process , if he wants to plagiarize from other articles .\n",
      "S Therefore , it cuts away all the experience of encountering problems during the solution analyzing and selecting and all the innovative skills he can gain from the process .\n",
      "S Instead , plagiarism directly gives the final and the best solution for the student , which seems good for him but quite harmful for the entire academic community .\n",
      "S If everyone plagiarizes to do their academic work and only tries his luck to get higher marks , the problem of plagiarism may result in a more serious situation , that is , very few students graduated from universities can manage to develop innovative products as engineers .\n",
      "S Another serious problem that hampers the engineering design process for innovations is the insufficiency of scientific fund support .\n",
      "S There are a number of colleges and universities whose laboratories are not fully developed .\n",
      "S If the university can not afford engineering students to do further testing or create an entire product , all the efforts that have been made in the previous steps become zero .\n",
      "S The problem has significant impacts on the step of testing and implementing solutions in the design process , during which an engineer may encounter different problems and choices .\n",
      "S Without the process of testing and implementing , students can not gain their practical skills or develop their innovative ideas for implement .\n",
      "S Therefore , the insufficiency of scientific fund support also significantly hinders the engineering design process for innovations .\n",
      "S Although the academic community in my home country is facing many problems hampering innovations , the development of the science and technology has never been pulled down .\n",
      "S I believe that one day all the problems are solved and we get strong enough in academic field .\n",

      "S They can be classified into two categories - research-based inventions such as the laptop computer at Toshiba and serendipitous inventions such as the \" Post-it \" notes developed by 3M .\n",
      "S Although these innovations are different in nature , they are common in many ways .\n",
      "S The main difference between a technology which was developed via research and a technology which resulted from a serendipitous discovery is the extent of the presence of luck .\n",
      "S It is a common knowledge that chance often is a factor in making a discovery ( Miller , 1998 ) .\n",
      "S A serendipitous discovery of technology by its name , suggests that it is an unexpected outcome of a search for solutions to another problem .\n",
      "S It is accidental by nature .\n",
      "S For instance , Dr. Spence Silver , a 3M scientist , intended to produce a super strength adhesive , produced a weak adhesive instead ( Connell , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S This failure was converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher , Art Fry used the bonding agent to create \" Post-it \" pads ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S On the other hand , a research-based technology is built upon the problem that the inventor has intended to solve .\n",
      "S There is no de-railing of the initial plan .\n",
      "S For example , Tetsuya Mizoguchi saw a need for a portable personal computer in Japan ad invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Comparing the two technologies , it is clear that more elements of luck are present in the former invention than in the latter one .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , luck is not the only determining factor for the birth of a technology , whether it is developed via research or resulted from a serendipitous discovery .\n",
      "S There are other contributing factors such as the efforts of the inventors and their determinations to succeed that lead to the discovery of the technology .\n",
      "S For any technology to be developed , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and effort in their research .\n",
      "S Serendipitous discoveries may be accidental but they are not fortuitous .\n",
      "S They involve a deliberate process of search for a solution to a problem ( Cunha , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the unanticipated discovery of technology has to be further processed and worked on in order for it to solve another problem .\n",
      "S Dr. Spence Silver spent five years evangelizing the potential benefits of his adhesive invention to internal 3Mers to gain new product development support .\n",
      "S It took another five years for Art Fry to perfect the specifications and design machines to manufacture the product ( Connell , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Similarly , the inventor of a research-based technology has to conduct multiple purposeful research and overcome numerous challenges before he succeeds .\n",
      "S Mizoguchi invented the first Toshiba laptop computer after several years .\n",
      "S The process of creating the invention was tough as he did not gain the support of the corporate leaders and was denied of development funds and a laptop R&D team ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Hence for all serendipitous and research-based technologies to be discovered , the inventors have to spend a lot of time and energy in their works .\n",
      "S In addition to the amount of time and energy sacrificed , the inventors must have the perseverance in order to successfully create a technology .\n",
      "S This is an important factor for both research-based and serendipitous technologies .\n",
      "S The inventors are bound to face many obstacles during the process of making their inventions .\n",
      "S For example , 3M leaders showed no interest of the weak adhesive product for nearly five years ; however , due to the perseverance and heroic efforts of Silver and Fry , the invention finally gained recognition ( Connell , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Likewise , Mizoguchi disobeyed the company 's orders and risked his career for the sake of innovation-development ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",

      "S In the view of social construction of technology , many technological innovations and inventions are influenced and shaped by social factors ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Social factors are classified into economic factors , military demands , and government regulations in general .\n",
      "S The values and norms of society significantly influence the process of scientific innovations ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S As illustrated in the article \" The Generation of Innovation \" ( Rogers , 2003 ) , the process of how the refrigerator got its hum is a typical instance of social construction of technology .\n",
      "S During this process , gas refrigerators with no noise were gradually replaced by electric refrigerators under the influence of social factors .\n",
      "S These factors mainly include the investment of companies , need of customers as well as purpose of saving energy .\n",
      "S First of all , the main reason for this innovation is that the major corporations such as General Electric , General Motors , Kelvinator , and Westinghouse consider that investing in electric refrigerators instead of gas refrigerators would be able to produce more profit ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Although it was once expected that gas refrigerators would dominate the market , the investment of main corporations has determined the dominant role of electric refrigerators .\n",
      "S In this case , the technological innovation has been driven by the interest of its investors and developed for greater profit for companies .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the evolution of refrigerators is also shaped by the demand of customers .\n",
      "S Refrigerators with better mechanism as well as working capacity are demanded by the market .\n",
      "S The need of customers affected the interests and decisions of investing companies , hence influence the development of refrigerators as well .\n",
      "S In fact , some of the interests of corporations like General Electric are driven by the demand of customers .\n",
      "S What the customers are willing to buy gave rise to the preference of companies .\n",
      "S Production decisions are made to meet the market demand and maximize the profit , and the root of the decisions lies in customers ' expectation .\n",
      "S Last but not the least , the consideration of saving energy also accounts for the development of this innovation .\n",
      "S Using electricity in refrigerators instead of gas has changed the mechanism inside the product , which is a significant technological progress .\n",
      "S And the driving force beyond this is the purpose of saving energy and protecting limited resources on our planet .\n",
      "S The limited resource is a social problem which is the concern of both customers and producers who facilitate the invention significantly .\n",
      "S Government policies also interfere to advocate energy saving .\n",

      "S As people get more educated , they are able to shape the technology at their disposal to adapt it to themselves .\n",
      "S Hence the reverse happens and technology is shaped socially to a much larger extend than it was in the past .\n",
      "S How technology is shaped socially is dependant on the following factors , namely , economic , military and consumer demands .\n",
      "S The first commercial laptop that was ever created , IBM PC Convertible , weighed at a hefty 5.4 kg !\n",
      "S ( Source : http : //communication.howstuffworks.com/laptop6.htm ) .\n",
      "S It was sold for $ 3,500 .\n",
      "S From the weight of the machine we could see that it was not exactly as portable as it claimed to be .\n",
      "S Hence the sales did badly in the initial years .\n",
      "S The same went for the other first laptops from other companies such as Toshiba and Apple Computer .\n",
      "S Since then , the companies that manufacture laptops started doing intensive research and developments to improve their products so as to create a product that people would be willing to buy .\n",
      "S Hence from this we can see that how technology development was shaped by economic factor .\n",
      "S The low demands for the first laptops caused the companies to suffer losses in the business and thereby forcing then to work harder to develop it to be more commercially viable to boost their sales to survive as there are many competitors in this field of portable computing technology .\n",
      "S Nowadays the laptops weigh only a small fraction of their predecessors but with many times greater computing power .\n",
      "S Hence the sales of the laptops increased substantially and the companies make profits .\n",
      "S But they are constantly driven to improve their products so that they can gain an edge over their competitors to increase their profits .\n",
      "S Given the rapidly changing world , modern militaries are also adopting new technologies that are commercially available such as the laptop in order to execute their missions with higher efficiency and effectiveness .\n",
      "S But not all commercially available products can withstand the rigour demands of the military which requires the laptops to be tough , water- resistant and long battery life .\n",
      "S For example , the Singapore Armed Forces ( SAF ) are currently undergoing transition to a 3rd Generation ( 3G ) Army , they are equipping their frontline soldiers with laptops so as to communicate more effectively their position , situational awareness as well as to provide important battle information to the command centre which will be able to oversee the battle field and execute decisions at greater speed and efficiency .\n",
      "S This is vital as the speed at which information is communicated can determine if the mission will succeed .\n",
      "S Hence they adopted the Panasonic toughbooks that provides rugged reliability suitable for the most demanding missions .\n",
      "S The demands by not just the SAF but also other big militaries around the world also shaped at how the laptop was able to adapt to be just in the extreme conditions .\n",
      "S Moreover , the technology that resulted from developing the toughbooks can be applied and used to some extend in the commercial world .\n",
      "S Hence this shows how technology is shaped militarily .\n",
      "S With the increasingly globalised world and widespread travelling by people , there is greater mobility .\n",
      "S People can now be travelling to other countries to work .\n",
      "S Hence people also will want greater mobility in their computers , which is why the laptop was invented in the first place .\n",
      "S With the laptop , people can now be working anywhere and anytime , not be chained to their work desks as their desktop computers are not portable at all .\n",
      "S So the companies are competing to develop laptops that are lighter , smaller and pack in more functions and computing power so as to meet consumer demands .\n",
      "S People can now work on the move and be more efficient by multitasking .\n",
      "S But people have unlimited wants , they are not contented with just the laptop with is considered quite bulky at times , thus they demanded laptops that are smaller , lighter .\n",
      "S Just recently , a new class of computing devices emerged .\n",
      "S They are the netbooks .\n",
      "S They are much smaller , lighter than the laptops and can be fitted into small bags comfortably .\n",
      "S They cater to the increasingly mobile workforce with can work anyway on the go as they are able to surf the internet and work on documents .\n",
      "S This functionality comes only at a fraction of the cost and weight of the laptops .\n",
      "S Hence there are people willing to buy the netbooks .\n",
      "S Hence this shows that the consumer factor also influenced the development of laptops to a great extend .\n",
      "S The laptop is indeed an important technology that is shaped by economic and military factors , and consumer demands .\n",
      "S These are the main reasons behind the social forces that shape development of this technology .\n",
      "S Companies will want to create a product that is demanded by the world so as to make profits to survive .\n",

      "S As a result of decentralization , packet switching , unlike the telephone system , will not break down when one part of the network systems is faulty since the packets can be rerouted until it arrived at its intended destination .\n",
      "S In order to destroy this decentralize communication system , all the channels of transmission will have to be destroyed .\n",
      "S Three years later , J.C.R .\n",
      "S Licklider , a researcher under Advance Research Project Agency ( ARPA ) proposed that computers were the keys to network communication .\n",
      "S With the inclusion of computers as a link to network communications , a system of protocol had to be created to standardize network communication .\n",
      "S The interface message processor ( IMP ) became part of the actual language that linked computers to the network ; it defined how they would connect , route and verify the messages received .\n",
      "S Thus the IMPs , together with the telephone lines , and data sets would constitute a 'message-switching network .\n",
      "S ' The protocols would define the communications formats between the IMP 's and became the format through which all the computers in a network were connected to .\n",
      "S The following two decades witness the improvisation and spread of networking .\n",
      "S Network Control Protocol ( NCP ) was developed by VInt Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1973 to allow network communication of people using different hardware .\n",
      "S Consequently , networks were able to connect to different parts of the world .\n",
      "S For instance in 1973 , the U.S. has connected its network to both the United Kingdom and Norway .\n",
      "S In the mid 1970s , networks began to spread to research universities across America and internationally .\n",
      "S The governments of France , Japan , Germany and other European nations also developed research networks .\n",
      "S In the early 1980s , there was a growing demand for network usage by researchers and students .\n",
      "S However , it was costly to be part of the ARPANET because ARPANET had a tight control on the usage of network .\n",
      "S The frustrated Duke students Tom Trusscott and James Ellis , and Steve Bellovin , a student at UNC , created Usenet .\n",
      "S Within a few years , there were more postings and news groups than the system could handle .\n",
      "S By 1982 , there were hundreds of postings a day to as many different news groups .\n",
      "S Usenet was much more popular than ARPANET .\n",
      "S Although there were over 230 ARPANET sites in 1982 , Usenet take less than two years to reach that number .\n",
      "S The popularity of Usenet was due to the fact that it was inexpensive and provided semi-anonymous communication through which people could share their ideas .\n",
      "S This resulted in hundreds of discussion groups , each discussing different subjects , which range from politics to daily life experience .\n",
      "S The explosive growth of network usage resulted in all of the networks to switch from NCP to TCP/IP in 1983 .\n",
      "S The new TCP/IP protocol was able to deal with the increased electronic traffic of the developing Internet .\n",
      "S In 1987 , the National Science Foundation , which has funded a program earlier in 1984 to create national infrastructure to provide a variety of academic institutions access to a larger national academic network , backed away from funding the Internet and allowed giant corporation such as IBM , MCI and Merit Corp to manage and support the infrastructure it had funded .\n",
      "S It was not until 1993 where the Internet was transformed from government-funding to commercialization by private sectors .\n",
      "S With the creation of World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN , the European Nuclear Research Centre , the World Wide Web opened up a new era of individualism and creativity that will change the information age once and for all .\n",
      "S In conclusion , it was the historical background during the era of Cold War that prompted the US government to consider new ways of creating indestructible communication to enable the political and military leaders to communicate with each other during a nuclear attack .\n",
      "S Through the works of brilliant researchers , the Internet , which has limited to a few users at first , was improvised to accommodate increase electronic traffic and finally commercialize to be available to each and individual of us .\n",
      "S Technology is an act of designing and inventing of a tool that will either solve a problem recognized or fulfill a particular human need , in other words it is a product of society .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , the success of the invention is full of uncertainties as the responses from other parties involved , such as the society or government , are not predictable .\n",
      "S If the product is not accepted by consumers or widely used , the product has failed socially .\n",
      "S There are many factors that contribute to the failure of a product socially and one of them is the economic factor which monopolizes the consumer market .\n",
      "S The case study on Cowan ( 1985 ) is a representative example of failure of product due to economic factor , in which a aggressively advertised product is preferred over the other that can bring much more advantages .\n",
      "S Cowan ( 1985 ) discussed about the two types of refrigerators developed , the electric refrigerator and the gas refrigerator .\n",
      "S The gas refrigerator should have been more preferred by consumers since it brings along overwhelming advantage but it turned out to be otherwise .\n",
      "S The extensive promotion of the electric refrigerator , which its research and development investment was funded by corporations , influenced the choice of consumers since the gas refrigerator was not widely promoted and made known to consumers .\n",
      "S Such cases are typical examples of how a technological invention is shaped by economic factor , in which the technology made available to the consumer was directed by corporations ' profits earned instead of offering the one that benefits consumer most .\n",
      "S One of the reasons behind such situations is probably due to corporations ' fear of losing their share of the market and thus suppresses new technology to minimize chances of it happening .\n",
      "S This , however , affects consumer 's acceptance of inventions directly , in which the choice made will then be economically driven rather than based on the usefulness of inventions .\n",
      "S Another contributing factor of the success of invention will be the buying power of consumer , which very much depends on the economic situation then .\n",
      "S In times of economic recession , it is of lower tendency for consumer to purchase the more expensive refrigerator when both have the same primary functions that is to store up food at low temperature .\n",
      "S For that , the competition among corporate and the extent of price slashing they are willing to offer such that they still earn an amount of considerable profit may help improve consumer 's acceptance of their product .\n",
      "S Therefore , it can be concluded that functionality may not be only determining factor to the success of technology since it may not be the priority of consumer 's concern , but rather how the technology is commercialized and diffused to the public or society .\n",
      "S As such , technology nowadays needs not only to prove its functionality but also spend efforts on creating its awareness since it is up to the consumers , who come in contact with many advertisements in their life and is eventually conditioned , to make the decisions .\n",
      "S Due to the flourishing of construction industries over the years , the construction industries worldwide consume resources equivalent to more than what the nature are able to produce on Earth .\n",
      "S In this rate of consumption , our environment will not be able to supply us with sufficient resources years down the road .\n",
      "S In order to compensate and preserve the right of nature , there is a need to implement a system whereby waster construction materials can be treated and re-used .\n",
      "S This implementation will help protect the environment by controlling amount of resources consume ; reduce cost of manufacturing and importing of raw materials ; reduce the cost of construction and even maximise economy advantages .\n",
      "S Therefore , the introducing of recycling and reusing of construction waste materials are wise construction practises and are beneficial to the contractors , owner and the communities .\n",
      "S Most of the discarded materials are actually valuable commodities ; such as concrete , wood , asphalt , metal and cardboard ; which can be recycled into new products .\n",
      "S These materials made up to 80 percent of discarded materials .\n",
      "S In fact , by recycling and reusing these materials can benefit the environment , the construction business and is economical .\n",
      "S The process of recycling of construction waste involves separating and reusing recoverable and useable waster construction materials during demolition .\n",
      "S The advantage of this treatment system not only will produce low-cost recycled materials , it may also produce new composite of materials with better characteristic .\n",
      "S However , few considerations should be taken into account during the design process .\n",
      "S During the remodelling of buildings most construction waste goes into landfill , hence increases burden on the landfill loading .\n",
      "S These wastes may be high in chemical content which result in water and soil pollution .\n",
      "S Whereas some can be recycled and re-use as similar material while others to be reconstituted to other form of usable materials .\n",
      "S Moreover , recycling which need reprocessing may not be economically feasible because it requires a facility using recycled resources to be located near the source .\n",
      "S Thus , site separation is an important step for recycling of construction waste .\n",
      "S Although initially it requires extra effort and training , once separation habits are set up , it can be done at very low cost .\n",
      "S Khandani ( 2005 ) described engineers as creator as well as problem solvers who invent and design .\n",
      "S He also stated that engineering design is a process of creative thinking of turning ideas to physical products ; it is also a system , which is created by human effort and do not suddenly appear from nowhere , they are the combination of bringing technologies to fulfil the needs of human and to help us solve difficulties .\n",
      "S In fact , re-cycling waste construction materials is just the same , it is a technology used to support human needs of living by build infrastructures and help to solve difficulties by cutting down consumption of natural resources to save Earth .\n",
      "S The world today is changing continuously where it faced many global challenges and problems .\n",
      "S As a result , technologies have been constantly developed in order to response to human needs .\n",
      "S Once the needs are identified , ideas have to be developed through research .\n",
      "S Example of such technology is the development of tomato- harvesting machine where an agricultural scientist at the University of California at Daris predicted there will be a serious shortage of the labour in California ( Rogers , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S However , technologies can also be created through serendipitous discovery .\n",
      "S As the name implies , it is a new discovery of a valuable idea by accident .\n",
      "S One example is the discovery of the Penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming where he realized the presence of the antibacterial agent while researching on influenza .\n",
      "S This leads to the birth of the Penicillin which is widely used as antibiotics ( Mary Bellis , About.com ) .\n",
      "S Although the two technologies are created in a very different approach , both have to undergo the innovation-development process where the final product can be marketed .\n",
      "S According to Rogers ( 2003 ) , the innovationdevelopment process consists of all the decisions , activities , and their impacts that occur from recognition of a need or a problem through research , development , commercialization of an innovation , through diffusion and adoption of the innovation by users to its consequences .\n",
      "S Therefore it is extremely time-consuming to develop a new technology .\n",
      "S For a technology that is deliberately invented , it generally requires much a longer time frame as compared to those fortuitous discoveries .\n",
      "S This is because inventors had to generate multiple solutions to solve for the problem identified .\n",
      "S Much research has to be prepared so that the best solution could be found .\n",
      "S In the case of the tomato harvesting machine , there are plenty of factors that need to be consider .\n",
      "S If the tomatoes have to be harvested by a machine , they have to breed hard tomato varieties so that they will not be crushed .\n",
      "S However in the case of the serendipitous discoveries , identifying a problem or need as well as selecting the best solution are eliminated .\n",
      "S Hence the total time consumed is much shorter compared to the technology develop through research .\n",
      "S However , no matter whether it is created intentionally or unintentionally , both required the ability to think creativity and innovatively as well as some coincidence and luck .\n",
      "S In the case of a deliberate technology , inventors must not restrict themselves to only one solution but exposed themselves to the various possible solutions .\n",
      "S These solutions have to be analyzed and research further until the best solution is found .\n",
      "S If luck is presence with coincidence , the best solution will be generated in a shorter time .\n",
      "S Similarity , the person must have the ability to view things in a different perspective , have sufficient background knowledge about the serendipitous discoveries and some luck for serendipitous discoveries to take place .\n",
      "S Since fortuitous discovery often occurs while research was carried out in a totally unrelated field , they must be able to identify the technology that came by accidentally .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the fundamental of inventing a new technology is to meet the needs of human .\n"

      "S Rogers ( 2003 ) brought forward the idea that society is coming to a generation of innovation , which implicates that innovation is gradually becoming the main tasks of various enterprises and scientific research .\n",
      "S In every day 's newspaper , it is usual to find news regarding some enterprise adopting a new technology .\n",
      "S However , the products in market are not updating as fast as the innovation introduced to the public .\n",
      "S This is because the innovation in technology is not only technologically decisive but also socially decisive .\n",
      "S Social factors include economic factors , military demands , government regulations and so on .\n",
      "S Usually , a new technology will be tested by more than one factor and the results will directly affect the future of the new technology .\n",
      "S Firstly , the new technology must satisfy consumer 's needs .\n",
      "S Before the refrigerator was introduced to market in a mass , there was a competition between two prototypes of refrigerator .\n",
      "S The old type has a motor that drives a compressor that condenses a liquid , releasing heat into the surrounding environment that the liquid had previously absorbed inside the refrigerator when the liquid vaporized .\n",
      "S A superior alternative is the gas refrigerator , in which the ammonia refrigerant is vaporized by heating it with a gas flame .\n",
      "S Later , the refrigerant dissolves in water , thus cooling the refrigerator box .\n",
      "S The gas refrigerator has no moving parts and hence is unlikely to break down .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the gas type hardly has noise , which solves the most severe problem regarding the noise ( Cowan , 1985 ) .\n",
      "S Because of these overwhelming advantages , people expected that gas refrigerator would dominate the consumer market .\n",
      "S However , it was defeated by electrical refrigerators because of some other factors\n",
      "S The example of refrigerator competition interprets that whether to adopt a new technology depends on other social factors other than consumers ' needs .\n",
      "S To continue the previous example , the reason why gas type lost in the competition is due to the high research and development cost , several dominant cooperation thought electrical refrigerators would make more profit , then they invested large amounts of money in producing electrical refrigerator and developing market .\n",
      "S The aggressive occupancy of market compelled smaller companies which prefer producing gas refrigerator give up .\n",
      "S In this way , gas refrigerators were washed out of the market .\n",
      "S Whether a new technology will be popularized usually depends on more than one factor .\n",
      "S Mostly , they will give reverse responses after considering in different angles , but people can still make decisions based on the more crucial factor or the factor they concerned the most .\n",
      "S Apart from consumers ' need and producing cost , other factors like environmental problems , military demands and government regulations also affect the adoption of a new technology .\n",
      "S To sum up , in the generation of innovation , the development of technology is not just technologically decisive , but more socially decisive .\n",
      "S When scientists or enterprisers decide to adopt a new technology , the social factors will directly affect their decisions .\n",
      "S A good technology without profit will not fetch them .\n",
      "S Hence , we can conclude that social factors can determine the fortune of a new technology .\n",

      "S From five aspects - discovery , creativeness , time taken , acceptance of the project by company and also from problem solving - we can see that there are similarities and difference in these two approaches .\n",
      "S The examples I am using for this essay for serendipitous discovery and developed via research is 3M Post-it pads and Toshiba Laptop respectively .\n",
      "S One obvious difference is the way it is invented .\n",
      "S One of the well-known accidental inventions , according to E.M. Rogers ( 1950 ) , happened several decades ago , 3M researcher found a new bonding agent , but decided it was worthless because it did not stick paper very tightly to a surface .\n",
      "S This failure converted into a successful product when a 3M researcher used the new bonding agent to create \" Post-it \" .\n",
      "S As for Toshiba laptop is developed via research , Mizoguchi foresee that portable personal computer can be invented when he visit the United States with an R&D team form Toshiba .\n",
      "S He was certain to make it came true .\n",
      "S Creativeness is always one of the important factors in inventing things .\n",
      "S An accidental discovery requires a member of the team to think of the product related during another process of making another product .\n",
      "S This person must be able to think out of the box .\n",
      "S But for Mizoguchi , he has set his target on developing a laptop .\n",
      "S However , both inventions require creative thinking in order to produce excellent product .\n",
      "S Another major difference is the length of time used on the research .\n",
      "S For serendipity discovery , the time taken is considered short .\n",
      "S As it happens to produce a new bonding agent that did not stick paper tightly to a surface , which is not originally what the 3M researchers ' want , but one of the researcher used the new bonding agent to create \" Post-it \" , which became one of the most profitable products in 3M company .\n",
      "S Whereas , most developed technology via research took a long time because it needs to keep researching and try , if failed , try again until it became an invention .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , both of the inventions require time and effort to create miracles in the world .\n",
      "S Fourth , the difference between accidental invention and research to develop products is which problem the researchers are solving .\n",
      "S Problem solving for accidental invention is not solving the original problem for the research while solving the main problem is what developing invention via research is trying to do .\n",
      "S Last but not least , one of the major problems with serendipity discovery is , it requires an extra step to get approval from the company in order to mass produce or even continue to do the project .\n",
      "S Whereas , technology development , they meant to do the project naturally .\n",
      "S We can see from the above , inventing things is not an easy task .\n",
      "S Each of the findings has it difficulties .\n",
      "S Be it serendipity or developed through research inventions , it benefits to human lives .\n",
      "S In the world today , most humans are leading convenient and comfortable lives .\n",
      "S This is made possible due to the innovations engineers have produced to improve on the lives of mankind .\n",
      "S What is the engineering design process that produced so many useful innovations like ?\n",
      "S According to khandani , S. ( 2005 ) , engineering design consists of five steps : defining the problem , gathering information , brainstorming for solutions , selecting the best solution and finally the implementation of the solution .\n",
      "S These are the general steps to the formulation of an innovation .\n",
      "S This process requires certain skills from the engineer , such as creativity , ability to learn from failure .\n",
      "S In singapore , the local society and education system produces problems that hinder the usage of the engineering design process .\n",
      "S The first problem will be the focus of the Singapore education system .\n",
      "S It has evolved over the years , from textbook learning to the introduction of hands-on learning to equip students with skills such as creativity .\n",
      "S However , the implementation of hands-on learning is only carried out to a small extent .\n",
      "S learning is still heavily dependent on textbooks today .\n",
      "S In addition , education in singapore is fast paced and result orientated .\n",
      "S From primary schools to junior colleges , lecturers are always rushing through lessons in order to be able to finish the syllabus on time .\n",
      "S Whether students learned or not depends on the outcome of major examinations such as GCE 'O ' and 'A ' levels .\n",
      "S These exams do not concentrate on the learning process .\n",
      "S Instead , it focuses on the answers .\n",
      "S With such an education system in place , what students learn are confined to what the textbook offers , with minimal development of critical skills such as creativity and analysis .\n",
      "S This trend will impede the engineering design process at the brainstorming and selection of solution stages .\n",
      "S In the brainstorming stage , the innovator must be able to think of solutions that are non-existant in reality .\n",
      "S This requires alot of creativity .\n",
      "S Next , the selection of the best solution requires the innovator to possess strong analytical skills .\n",
      "S These skills are critical to the two stages of the design process , but is lacking in locals due to the effect of the education system .\n",
      "S Another problem faced in singapore is society 's mindset .\n",
      "S Life in singapore is highly competitive and fast paced , hence parents believe that their children must possess outstanding paper qualifications to survive .\n",
      "S As a result , they enroll their children in tuition classes to enhance their academic performance , depriving them of the chance to develop their critical skills .\n",
      "S Moreover , majority of the locals are apathetic to their surroundings .\n",
      "S Everyone minds their own business , and do not bother themselves with what happens around them , unless it concerns them .\n",
      "S In the current state of society , people are not adept at analysing information and observing problems , and even if they did , they will deny its presence .\n",
      "S This behaviour will jeopardise the steps where the problem is defined and the selection of the best solution .\n",
      "S To be able to define a problem , the innovator must be observant enough to see the problem , and bothers to do something to improve it , hence creating an innovation .\n",
      "S The skills are vital to the two stages of the process , therefore society 's mindset poses a problem to the design process .\n",
      "S In conclusion , for Singapore to have outstanding innovators , the problems in the education system and the mindset of society must be addressed .\n",
      "S People must be more creative , able to think analytically and change their mindsets .\n",
      "S However , two problems are not the only problems that will impact the design processes negatively .\n",
      "S There are other problems that require attention .\n",
      "S With these problems rectified , then Singapore will have more innovators , and hopefully more useful innovations to improve people 's lives .\n",
      "S Global warming is a threat that we are becoming more anxious about .\n",
      "S One of the causes of this environmental degradation is from carbon emissions , especially , carbon emissions emitted from car exhausts .\n",
      "S Hence , the electric vehicle is an important technology as it is a possible alternative and replacement for future cars .\n",
      "S The electric vehicle wins over the petroleum vehicle as it produces less carbon emissions .\n",
      "S Being an environmentally-friendly vehicle , it should be a popular choice .\n",
      "S However , they are poorly adopted and according to Autodata , electric vehicles only make up 2.8 % of today 's cars .\n",
      "S Thus , it is likely that the popularity of electric vehicles is socially-determined .\n",
      "S Economic , governmental and psychological factors could have shaped this technological innovation .\n",
      "S One factor that has shaped the electric vehicle is the economics of owning an electric vehicle .\n",
      "S Cost is a major consideration in a consumer 's decision-making process .\n",
      "S The maintenance cost when the electric vehicle was first introduced was high .\n",
      "S This made the electric cars more expensive than petrol-run cars .\n",
      "S For instance , the battery pack in typical electric cars did not last long .\n",
      "S According to Gruening ( 1995 ) , the battery pack had to be replaced every 20,000 to 30,000 miles .\n",
      "S Consequently , this made the electric vehicles more expensive than petrol vehicles and hence less affordable to most families on a budget .\n",
      "S Besides the low lifespan of the batteries , the time required to recharge an electric vehicle was much longer than the time required to refuel a fuel tank .\n",
      "S For many , time wasted waiting would translate to high opportunity cost .\n",
      "S Thus , these economic factors could be reasons why electric vehicles were poorly adopted .\n",
      "S Besides economic factors , government regulations and laws also played a part in shaping the electric vehicles .\n",
      "S The California and Arizona state governments , in the 1990s , mandated that at least 10 percent of the total sales of automobile companies would have to be non-polluting .\n",
      "S Rogers ( 2003 ) notes that these laws prompted General Motors to invest in the designing , manufacturing and marketing of the electric vehicle .\n",
      "S As a result , the concept of the electric car was widely promoted in the United States of America .\n",
      "S In addition , tax rebates and incentives added on the attractiveness of buying an electric vehicle .\n",
      "S For example , the Climate Change Bill in the United States included incentives to set up charging stations and subsidies for people buying the cars .\n",
      "S These offer made by the government made these vehicles competitive to the petroleum cars in prices .\n",
      "S Therefore , it can be seen that the government 's involvement in promoting environmentally-friendly vehicles affected how marketable electric vehicles are .\n",
      "S Moreover , psychological factors of owning an electric vehicle have affected the outcome of the electric vehicles in the market .\n",
      "S A technical limitation of the electric vehicle the range of travel it can offer .\n",
      "S An electric vehicle with a fully-charged battery is not able to travel as far as a petroleum vehicle with a fully-filled fuel tank .\n",
      "S Although families who needed a car as a mode of transport did not usually require traveling for long distances , there is a psychological perception of having their freedom being restricted .\n",
      "S Hence , they will prefer a petroleum car which has a potential in allowing them to travel farther .\n",
      "S Thus , the strong desire for freedom might have affected the popularity of the electric car .\n",
      "S In short , there are several factors that could have shaped the electric vehicles .\n",
      "S Economic and psychological factors might have dissuaded many from supporting them while the government plays a prominent role in encouraging the growth of the electric vehicle industry .\n",
      "S However , there is a close relationship between the social factors and the technical challenges that the electric vehicles face .\n",
      "S Hence , the recognition of electric vehicles by society could be affected by both social factors and challenges faced in the present technology of the electric vehicle .\n",

      "S Technology innovation is significant to the world .\n",
      "S Without it , our society could not have progressed , nor would our life become convenient .\n",
      "S According to Roster ( 2003 ) , technology innovation development is a process begins with recognition of a problem or need , which arouses research and development activities designed to create an innovation to solve the problem or need .\n",
      "S Five stages can describe this process : problem , research , development , commercialization diffusion and consequences ( Roster , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S While , different countries have different way to perform these stages .\n",
      "S So during the process , they encounter different obstacles , such as political issues , financial issues .\n",
      "S In China , currently two factors which are education system and economic situation that hamper the technology innovation process severely .\n",
      "S Firstly , the education system in China is imperfect to educate engineers so that in someway it hinders them from realizing their creativity and innovation .\n",
      "S University is an ideal place to cultivate engineers and prepare them for their future career .\n",
      "S However , most universities in China fail to meet their mission .\n",
      "S Due to the poor quality research facilities and imperfect way of teaching , students can not gain enough skills to be a qualified engineer .\n",
      "S In consequence , they can not successfully take the innovation process .\n",
      "S Besides , the connection between university or research institution and commercial sector is not close enough .\n",
      "S As a result , professional people are not able to recognize the problem effectively .\n",
      "S Moreover , more efforts are need if they want to commercialize the product from their research .\n",
      "S So many issues that sever as anti-force are aroused during the innovation progress .\n",
      "S Besides education problem , economic situation also produces barrier to the innovation process .\n",
      "S China is till a developing country , with the boom of economy , many problems also come up .\n",
      "S The mismatch between still low levels of technological development on the one hand , and enormous velocity of the catch-up process on the other makes company unwilling to innovate on their own .\n",
      "S Entrepreneurs ' main aim is to bring higher profits in a shorter time to their company .\n",
      "S However , the innovation process takes a long time and demands more efforts as well as costs .\n",
      "S On the other hand , there are techniques and skills available overseas .\n",
      "S Consequently , companies choose to import or imitate them from other country instead of develop on their own .\n",
      "S In the year 2005 , foreign invested corporations account for more than half of China 's export , and research-intensive high value added products are still largely imported .\n",
      "S Moreover , the lack of money to conduct technology research is also an important factor .\n",
      "S In 2000 , China invested 0.25 million in life science research .\n",
      "S Compared with 30 million which US government put in the life science research , 0.25 million is really tiny ( Factors that hamper innovation in China , 2004 ) .\n",
      "S In conclusion , educational problems limit engineering skills and cause inconvenience for researchers under university or institutions to identify problems and commercialize their product .\n",
      "S In addition , economic situation and current circumstance , as well as the financial problem also create barriers for innovation to take place .\n",

      "S These occurrences may seem common now , but they were definitely not in the early 1900s .\n",
      "S The advancement of technology over the last century was so breathtaking that one often wonders how the technologies were invented .\n",
      "S Were they created conventionally , which means that the general public knows about their development , or were they secretly developed in a skunkworks environment ?\n",
      "S Regardless of their distinctions , both technologies share similarities that make each of them unique and useful in their own ways .\n",
      "S The most significant contrast between the skunkworks technology and that of the conventional method is the vastly different confidential levels and aims which each technology works on .\n",
      "S In the case of skunkworks , the product being developed is known only to the researchers and the relevant organizations .\n",
      "S This ensures that the probability of information leakage regarding the product is kept to a minimum , so that the main objective of creating the product can be realized .\n",
      "S For example , Lockheed 's P-80 Shooting Star fighter jet , which was designed and built under the knowledge of only the researchers and the United States military , helped the US overcome the technology gap which Germany had over it during World War 2 .\n",
      "S On the other hand , corporations using conventionally generated technologies usually announce to the public their latest updates pertaining to their most recent creations .\n",
      "S The release of information is usually done by companies which wanted to flaunt their superiority over other similar companies competing in the same market .\n",
      "S The rivalry between Sony and Microsoft over the gaming console industry leads to both companies constantly improving their products and announcing it to the world so as to apply pressure on the other .\n",
      "S Thus , it can be seen that differing degrees of secrecy for disparate technologies stems from dissimilar aims .\n",
      "S Another difference between the two technologies is the impact that they create when both are in operation .\n",
      "S New innovations contrived in skunkworks environment usually revolutionize the world and propel the company which invented it to new heights while that is not the case for conventional technology .\n",
      "S The invention of personal computers in IBM 's skunkworks completely changed the way in which the world operates , and made IBM the forerunner in computers , but the upgrading of the computers with ordinary technical knowledge did not really lead people onto a new path , instead it only results in the proliferation of many small computer-based companies .\n",
      "S As a result , the market is now full of computers with different brands .\n",
      "S This maybe the unexpected positive side effect of using conventional technology , but compared to the skunkworks , it is relatively insignificant .\n",
      "S Despite of the differences , both technologies share some common traits .\n",
      "S First , both require a high level of accuracy .\n",
      "S There is not much room for error in both cases , as a slight mistake may result in devastating effects .\n",
      "S The skunkworks-produced P-80 fighter jet experienced numerous crashes , which resulted in many deaths , due to problems which were not analyzed accurately .\n",
      "S Similarly , the HIV vaccine was not researched adequately , causing many volunteers to contract the virus unwillingly .\n",
      "S Second , products that emerge from both technologies can be used for a long time .\n",
      "S It is important as this means that resources can be channeled to other areas of research .\n",
      "S Using the previous examples , the P-80 jet was used for close to 30 years before being replaced completely , while the HIV vaccine may be in use forever if the vaccine undergoes successful researches .\n",
      "S It is through these similarities that people can compare and advance on the current technology .\n",
      "S To sum it up , the major differences between skunkworks and conventional technology is the ripples which both technologies produce and the secrecy in which they are required to observe .\n",
      "S These are features that make each technology unique in its own way .\n",
      "S However , both technologies also possess similarities like the stringent levels of accuracy and the lifespan of the products generated , which shows that features can be adopted by more than one form of technology as long as it is beneficial .\n",
      "S Having a home is one of the most fundamental human needs .\n",
      "S Be it a shelter or a big house , everyone has to have a place they can call home .\n",
      "S Despite being a fundamental need , there are many people in the world who are unable to have a proper home .\n",
      "S According to the UN Human Settlements Programme , there are around a billion people out there who live in overcrowded housing with poor water quality , lack of sanitation , and no garbage collection .\n",
      "S With rapid urbanization and the world population increasing into the future , housing would prove to be a challenging issue .\n",
      "S A proper housing system has to be set up to deal with these housing issues and the best way to develop such a system would be using an engineering design process .\n",

      "S In recent years , surveillance technology is getting more and more popular,especially Radio-Frequency Identification ( RFID ) .\n",
      "S RFID is a kind of surveillance technology which uses tags and readers to gather information about items attaching with the tags .\n",
      "S While surveillance technology has contributed a lot to the society , it causes troubles such as privacy and security issues ( Anonymous 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Thus proper rules and regulations are needed for surveillance technology , i.e.the use of surveillance technology should be banned in a certain degree .\n",
      "S Privacy issue is the one that most people are concerning about .\n",
      "S RFID tags can simply be used as \" spy chips \" since the information in the tags can be read off in a distance and then people may \" watch \" on you without your permission or even awareness .\n",
      "S ( Anonymous 2007 ) Moreover , it is very difficult to get rid of RFID tag as these chips are too thin and tiny to be found and disabled ( Surinder MB 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , formal regulations about surveillance technology should be carried out and when privacy is affected , the use of such technology should be banned in such cases .\n",
      "S Another problem caused by surveillance technology is the security issue .\n",
      "S Whenever data is collected , the idea of data ownership would go along with it ( Surinder MB 2008 ) .\n",
      "S The problem about surveillance technology is that it is very difficult to control who owns the information .\n",
      "S For example , the unique RFID tag number on an purchased item can be linked to the credit card number used to pay for it ( Surinder MB 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Salesmen may make use of the information to sieve out potential customers and robbers may find out targets from it .\n",
      "S Hence , if the information is open to everyone , our safety in daily lives are not ensured anymore .\n",
      "S However , people may argue that surveillance technology is introduced to help ensure security , and it indeed works very well in preventing crimes to occur and providing information for investigation .\n",
      "S We can not deny that surveillance technology is effective and convenient , but if data ownership is not controlled , surveillance technology may become a threat to our safety .\n",
      "S Thus , the usage of surveillance technology should be banned when it is used in an abusive way .\n",
      "S In conclusion ,surveillance technology should be banned for certain degree to ensure that privacy is protected and the security issue is solved also .\n",

      "S As an emerging technology , genetic testing is getting more and more related to people 's life as being applied to predictions and diagnoses of diseases .\n",
      "S Since it could indicate the onset of diseases in the future , the results of genetic testing may tag a person with \" having inherited defects \" ( Buchanan , n.d. ) .Therefore , it aroused a controversy over that whether the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results .\n",
      "S In my opinion , the right of an individual to decide whether to reveal the results should be protected .\n",
      "S First and foremost , the results of genetic testing belong to medical privacy , which is one of the basic human rights .\n",
      "S An individual is endowed with the right to keep the sensitive medical record .\n",
      "S Additionally , genetic testing is not a mature technique at present and the interpretation of such results is very complicated and variable ( Rennie , 1994 ) .\n",
      "S To some extent , it is irresponsible to reveal the results which are inaccurate or even false .\n",
      "S Moreover , once the results are forced to be revealed , consequences may be significant .\n",
      "S The first one is about emotional impacts .\n",
      "S Genetic testing creates tension within a family because it conveys people the information of getting ill also implies other family members the possibility of having the same defect genes ( Kahn,2000 ) .\n",
      "S People may feel anxious , depressed , and even guilty of revealing the results .\n",
      "S Gradually , people 's life may be destroyed by psychological and mental problems .\n",
      "S The second consequence is about the genetic discrimination , especially in employment and insurance ( Norrgard , 2008 ) .Insurance may not be provided to an individual with results showing the possibility of getting ill .\n",
      "S Besides , it is disadvantageous for getting a job with results showing that the individual is genetically inferior .\n",
      "S In that sense , revealing genetic results may put much more stress on people .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the results of genetic testing do have big impacts of people 's life in terms of emotional impacts and genetic discrimination .\n",
      "S However , all the anxiety and pressure may be unnecessary because of the unreliability of such technology .\n",
      "S Therefore , the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results , and this is also in agreement of protecting human rights .\n",

      "S Henceforth , the use of RFID should be limited as of now .\n",
      "S Firstly , RFID is redundant as its very purpose of providing security is rendered useless due to the fact that it is relatively easy to copy information broadcasted by the tags ( Ou , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S For example , to gain access to a house protected by RFID , one would only need a scanner and be within range of the owner 's tag to copy all the information required for access since the RFID scanner can not differentiate between the duplicated information and the original form .\n",

      "S Genetic testing is a DNA-based test which involves direct examination of the DNA molecule .\n",
      "S Such testing can be used for carrier screening or symptomatic/presymptomatic testing .\n",
      "S The practice of genetic testing has raised many controversies on ethical and social issues .\n",
      "S Some people suggest that the results of gene tests should be revealed .\n",
      "S However , the individual requesting such testing should have the final say in whether to disclose the results of the testing .\n",
      "S There are four reasons on why the decision to disclose the results must lie on the individual requesting it .\n",
      "S Firstly , all results of genetic testing have some margin of errors ( Rennie 1994 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , the results should be kept confidential to prevent misuse and other potential drawbacks .\n",
      "S Secondly , \" one has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others , and no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property \" ( Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 , Article 17 ) .\n",
      "S In this case , the property concerned is the privacy of the medical results , meaning that the individual 's medical confidentiality is protected by Human Rights .\n",
      "S Thirdly , the revealing of the genetic testing results may create tension among a family .\n",
      "S Because genes are shared by members of the family , all of them have a fifty percent chance of carrying the same gene as one of them ( Rennie 1994 ) .\n",
      "S In other words , the results can also reveal information about other family members .\n",
      "S Consequently , feeling of depression and guilt may arise among the family .\n",
      "S Lastly , a person with known genetic results may experience 'genetic discrimination' .\n",
      "S For example , an individual with genetic disorders may have difficulty in obtaining insurance and/or employment ( Norrgard 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Some may argue that at-risk relatives should be informed about their susceptibility to genetic diseases , so that they can take early precaution or appropriate treatment to the diseases .\n",
      "S However , most genetic diseases have no means of prevention or treatment ( Norrgard 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , in most cases , disclosing the results of genetic testing to relatives will only bring psychological and mental stress upon them .\n",
      "S In conclusion , for the reason of privacy and technical unreliability as well as to avoid unwanted conditions such as 'genetic discrimination ' , the choice to take a genetic testing is an individual 's personal matter and the decision on whether to disclose the results or not depends solely on the individual .\n"

      "S It is very unfair for his or her family if the result is not disclosed to them moreover if the disease can only begin to show any symptom only when it is in the final stage , then the life of the person may be at danger .\n",
      "S Secondly , the genetic test 's result can help the individual to make a better decision in future ( Norrgard , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S For instance , a couple diagnosed with SMA * may think of alternative way of having children for example by IVF * * .\n",
      "S Some argue that the result is confidential since everyone 's genetic information is different ( Glenn , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S However , as argued before , everybody genes may be linked to their relatives ' genes , so it is possible for the relatives particularly their sibling to inherit the same defective gene .\n",

      "S But again , if they are charged at the same rate with normal people then they are being unfair to others and the insurance company since the treatment fee for such kind of genetic disease is high .\n",

      "S Employers have the responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their workers ( Andre , C. , & Velasquez , M. n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , this can only be done if individuals reveal their testing result .\n",
      "S In conclusion , individuals should not have the final say as any disorders that they may be found out will affect their family and also the result will allow their employer to provide them a safe working environment .\n",
      "S Advances in genetic testing allow one to detect the presence of abnormal gene which could cause genetic disorder .\n",
      "S This has brought about many debates on whether the individual who undergo genetic testing should have the final say in revealing the results .\n",
      "S While some proponents suggest that it is the privacy of the individual who undergoes the genetic testing , but the test results might also have adverse effects to those who are closely related to that person .\n",
      "S Hence , the individual undergoing the genetic testing should not have the final say in revealing the results .\n",
      "S Firstly , for an individual with positive genetic test results , he has no right in keeping the test results to himself .\n",
      "S He needs to inform his wife in order to make wise decision if they were to start a family ( When Do Doctors Recommend Genetic Testing ? , n.d. ) .\n",

      "S They argued that the job applicants should not be discriminated just because of the positive genetic test result ( Andre and Velasquez , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S However , with the knowledge of employees ' genetic disorders , employers can better reduce the occurrence of work-related diseases .\n",
      "S Employers can use the information acquired from genetic testing to ensure that their employees are not exposed to environmental agents that might caused them to have increase risk in genetic disorders .\n",
      "S This can ultimately lead to the reduction of work-days loss .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the individual requesting for genetic test should not have the final say in disclosing the test result as it affects not only one person but also the family and employers .\n",
      "S Nowadays , development of technology has been going on rapidly .\n",
      "S For instance is genetic testing .\n",
      "S In one side , it is very useful to diagnose many kind of genetic disease .\n",
      "S In other side , it is a dilemma for the people who are convinced having genetic disease to tell the the third party about his genetic testing result .\n",
      "S I strongly claimed that he should not have the final say .\n",
      "S He does n't have the right to disclose it .\n",
      "S First and foremost , He have to tell his prospective spouse or fiancee about his genetic testing result because ; some people who have abnormal gene inherited by their parent wo n't have observable symptoms of a the disease but will have a 50 : 50 chance of inheriting the disease to their children ( Genetic Testing , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S By telling to the spouse priorly , they can take preventive medic treatment before planning to have children .\n",
      "S The second reason is an obligation to tell his employer about his diseases .\n",
      "S Some people may argue that it is unfair to use of genetic tests in recruitment of employees or job applicants because it is treating people discriminatively based on fixed characteristic ( Andre , Velasquez , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S The main purpose of employment genetic screening which is to make sure that the prospective job is safe and not causing complication or any bad effect for those having this kind of diseases .\n",
      "S Hence , genetic testing for job screening purpose is n't violating employees ' right .\n",
      "S Last but not least is regarding the sake of other people around him .\n",
      "S Those who have this disease perceived a strong sense of responsibility to share this information with others ( Loescher , Crist , Siaki , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S To sum up , anyone who is suffering from genetic diseases or carrier of this diseases should not has a final say in whether to reveal or to hide about his disease .\n",
      "S Instead , it is a must for him to disclose his disease to : his spouse to save their baby from inheriting the disease , his employer to make sure that his job is safe and all people around him .\n",

      "S Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) is an automatic identification system that is used to identify people and items by the transmission of radio waves ( DiLorenzo , 2008 ) .\n",

      "S Therefore , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it would bring about negative impacts to the society .\n",
      "S There are two main reasons why using RFID to track people should be banned .\n",
      "S Firstly , it will cause impingement to privacy and security .\n",
      "S The use of RFID to track people enables law enforcement agencies to know our every move : our location , what we have bought and other information about our lives .\n",
      "S These private information may also be accessed by other parties as the RFID can be decoded and may be subjected to viral threats ( DiLorenzo , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Criminals may have access to these information and this may put our life in danger as these criminals can easily harm us once they know our exact location .\n",
      "S Secondly , human implantation of RFID to track people may pose health problems .\n",
      "S Animal studies on these RFID microchips suggested that RFID implantation in human may result in cancer ( Paddock , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S In addition , the implanted chip in the skin may move to other parts of the body .\n",
      "S This will cause difficulty in removing the chip and this may lead to other more serious health problems .\n",
      "S Proponents of using RFID to track people argued that such usage of RFID is important in the medical field as it helps to monitor patient 's health and enables the immediate retrieval of patient 's information ( Paddock , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , there is no guarantee that the RFID tag would be protected from security breaches .\n",
      "S As such , patient 's medical information may leak out , which in turn may result in social discrimination and loss of health care coverage .\n",
      "S Medical information stored in the RFID may also be altered by hackers and this would lead to error in diagnosis ( Sieberg , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the use of RFID to track people should be banned as it will cause invasion in privacy , security breaches as well as health problems when RFID chips are implanted .\n",
      "S In recent years , the advancements of 'Radio Frequency Identification ' ( RFID ) have led to its increased use in many major organisations .\n",
      "S One of the uses of RFID has been to track people .\n",
      "S However , critics have been quick to point out that it is an intrusion of privacy and are calling for it to be banned .\n",
      "S I believe that the benefits of RFID used in tracking people far outweigh the 'uncertain ' disadvantages and thus it should not be banned .\n",
      "S Firstly , RFID has been seen as a solution to track medical patients .\n",
      "S As mentioned by the \" American Medical Association \" ( Roberti 2007 ) , RFID allows quick and accurate identification and access to patients ' data in times of emergency .\n",
      "S This is to ensure \" improved continuity and coordination of care \" ( Roberti 2007 ) and reduce the probabilities in \" adverse drug events and other medical errors \" ( Roberti 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Secondly , the use of RFID has been adopted in oil companies such as \" Stratos \" ( Mehdizadeh 2007 ) to track and ensure workers ' safety .\n",
      "S With the integration of both RFID and Global Positioning System ( GPS ) , it is used to locate workers ' during emergencies .\n",
      "S RFID can also authenticate if the worker has the right to access certain areas and use certain machineries .\n",
      "S Critics though have been quick to identify that the \" unauthorised reading and changing of RFID data \" ( Tan and Li 2008 ) as an encroachment of privacy .\n",
      "S However , there have been measures being put in place such as the usage of \" Authentication \" ( Tan and Li 2008 ) to identify the reader .\n",
      "S This prevents \" counterfeiting behaviours \" and to \" control access to label contents \" ( Tan and Li 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Distracters have also argued that \" RFID may cause electromagnetic interference \" ( Roberti 2007 ) , exposing the user to the dangers of magnetic interference .\n",
      "S So far , there has not been a formal report confirming that worry .\n",
      "S In conclusion , I believe that the usage of RFID in tracking human should not be banned as the advantages of its usage outweigh its disadvantages .\n",
      "S And I have absolute trust in scientists to iron out the flaws to make RFID truly the \" perfect \" solution to many existing limited technology .\n",
      "S Genetic testing is used to examine the genes of a patient or a latent patient , in order to analysis the causes of some diseases .\n",
      "S It is now widespread and ranging from testing the congenital defect of a foetus to finding the existence of the oncogene .\n",
      "S However , with the application of genetic testing , some problems are revealed gradually , such as whether the patients should tell their families about their testing results .\n",
      "S In fact , everyone has to be responsible for the health of their families and themselves , hence , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the testing results , and these results should be made known to their relatives .\n",
      "S Firstly , it is immoral for a person to conceal his genetic testing results .\n",
      "S These results will not only affect this person but also affect his families .\n",
      "S It means that when a person tests positive for a gene mutation , his relatives may also have this mutation since they all have similar genes .\n",
      "S If the person does not tell his families about the test results , his families would not know their health deficiencies and would not tell their doctors .\n"

      "S For example , if a man 's genetic testing results indicated some pathogenic genes but he got married with a woman without telling her about these results , the woman might feel that she has been cheated after she knew the truth because she did not want to married to a man with gene deficiency .\n",

      "S The result of such genetic test affects not only the individual but also affects his family and his fiance .\n",
      "S Both sides of family members should have the right to know the result and will be able to make preventive and treatment measures .\n",
      "S Furthermore , if the couple is planning to give birth but one of them having a positive result of such testing , they can discuss with their closed family members whether to have baby or not .\n",
      "S Thus , there is not right for the individual taking such test to keep the result as a secret .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in my opinion , employers have the right to know such result to ensure that their prospective or current employees are not placed in environments that might be hazardous to them and also can react immediately if something happens ( Claire Andre and Manuel Velasquez , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S If the individual has the final say to decide whether to reveal the result , it is unfair for his closed family and also people who are related to him if the individual decide to keep the result to him .\n",

      "S Proponents may argue that the doctors should also release the genetic testing results to the relatives as these may also involved them .\n",
      "S However , it would be ridiculous that the relatives are able to know that they might also face this particular genetic disease in future from the individual 's results since everyone have a unique genome unless they are twins .\n",

      "S Generally , the consensus for this problem is that genetic information should not be disclosed against people 's privacy .\n",
      "S The choice to undergo genetic testing of an individual is personal , however , before deciding to undergo the test , the patient have to face the fear that his testing result may be disclosed and used against his welfare .\n",

      "S Meanwhile , surveillance on lax supervisors may evidently verify their incompetence ( Heathfield , n.d ) .\n",
      "S Namely , mutual surveillance guarantees active working environments , as well as bringing high productivity and huge profits to the employers .\n",
      "S Secondly , as Mr. Gray , Mayor of Lancaster , states , the use of surveillance technologies plays a utilitarian role in public security and criminals detecting ( Gray , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S For instance , video cameras in supermarkets can detect anyone suspicious of stealing or record the process of a burglary .\n",
      "S Sometimes criminals will be deterred if they are aware of the hidden surveillance .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the tracking of criminals using hi-tech sensors or video cameras largely shortens the chasing time of the police ( Stump , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Concerns of privacy issues might be crucial to constructing regulations on the implementation , however , the solutions are abundant thus the banning of surveillance technology is utterly unnecessary .\n",
      "S To illustrate , companies shall not be allowed to monitor phone calls expect for business related ones ( Heathfield , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Simultaneously , the safeguards should be briefed on their integrity so as not to reveal any information obtained through surveillance ; strict penalties should be enforced on those who fail to preserve privacy ( Gray , 2009 ) .\n",

      "S Nowadays , with advanced medical technology , people can apply genetic testing to identify changes in chromosomes , genes , or proteins ( Genetic Home Reference , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This kind of technique provides convincing results of the gene information that the individual carries .\n",
      "S While as it is more and more widely used in medical test , how to deal with the results appropriately brings fierce debates on ethic and other issues .\n",
      "S Some claim that the results of genetic testing belong to the privacy of the person , therefore whether to reveal them should depend on the individual himself .\n",
      "S However , if the final decision just depends on the individual , it will not only curb the genetic research development but also delay the precaution of potential risk that some genes convey .\n",
      "S Thus , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such thing .\n",
      "S There are two consequences that the individual should not have the final say on whether to reveal the results .\n",
      "S Firstly , it leads to a difficult situation for the experts to explore and apply further study on genetic research .\n",
      "S Since for most people who take genetic testing , they do not acquire adequate knowledge of results in medical sense .\n",
      "S In this case , they would rather decide whether to reveal the results in their favor .\n",
      "S As genetic results are precious resources for gene technology development , decision only can be made by the person puts genetic researchers into an awkward position for they can not use the information without his or her consent .\n",
      "S Secondly , keeping the results as a secret will delay the precaution of the potential genetic risk , especially those who have blood relationship .\n",
      "S According to the research , for a person tests positive for a gene mutation ( a change in a person 's genes ) , their children , siblings , and parents automatically have a 50 % chance of having the same mutation ( Cancer.Net , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S In other words , genetic testing results are crucial evidence to identify potential genetic risk .\n",
      "S Therefore , the result should at least be shared with his or her relatives .\n",
      "S Otherwise , it will delay the precaution , especially the relatives , of the risk that genetic disease brings .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the final say on whether to reveal the results of genetic testing should not depend on the individual as it not only has negative effects on genetic research development but also delays the precaution of potential health risk .\n",

      "S However , its thorough interception capability and high cost consumption raised strong controversies .\n",
      "S The resulting consequences discussed below will further consolidate our claim that surveillance technology usage should be banned .\n",
      "S Firstly , surveillance technology performed on large population implies violation of privacy and civil rights .\n",
      "S Government agencies conduct mass surveillance on social networking sites , phone calls and broadband internet traffic hence covertly record civilian 's private or confidential data .\n",
      "S In addition , corporate companies and central banks embedded RFID chips into products and paper notes with original purposes of tracking purchased products and cash passage between individuals .\n",
      "S ( Yoshida , 2001 ; Eden 2005 ) However , an individual 's anonymity and privacy will be gone simply when RFID scanners reveal one 's personal interests , purchase records , money transaction and current location .\n",
      "S Likewise , modern corporate companies profaned employee 's privacy by monitoring their performance at workplace , checking their email and phone log and tracking their movement at working hours .\n",
      "S ( Moore , 2000 ) Hence , disclosure and storage of personal information of those under mass surveillance lead to invasion of privacy and confidentiality .\n",
      "S In addition , lump sum government expenditure on surveillance implementation and maintenance is considered resources wastage .\n",
      "S For instance , estimations suggest that installation of nationwide surveillance network around China will account for $ 33 billion by year 2010 , which is \" around the same amount Congress has allocated for reconstructing Iraq \" .\n",
      "S ( Klein , 2008 , p. 6 ) Moreover , scientific research showed that majority public surveillance camera reduces crime merely to a slight degree which failed to overweigh annual equivalent cost .\n",

      "S Synthesis : Surveillance technology such as RFID should not be banned\n",
      "S The usage of surveillance technology such as RFID ( Radio-Frequency Identification ) on people or products has been a hot topic debated by both supporters and critics .\n",
      "S RFID tags has been introduced to the general public , but remains theoretical until the 11th September,2001 attack .\n",
      "S The idea came when a technology executive discovered that RFID tags may be used for identification if a body becomes disfigured or unrecognizable in an accident .\n",
      "S Thus , the RFID technology starts to materialize and propagates in public which causes commotions pertaining to privacy and ethical issues aroused from the usage of such technology .\n",
      "S Albeit the risk of privacy invasion , RFID tags are potential devices which do benefits a lot to humans if executed under strict regulations .\n",
      "S First and foremost , with the RFID surveillance technology , personal safety in public places can be enhanced .\n",
      "S By having RFID attached to a person , especially children , their whereabouts can be constantly watched by their parents and increases the safeguarding of their children .\n",
      "S However , there are issues concerning the dependence of technology instead of parents giving full attention towards their children by their own effort , and thus decreasing their sense of responsibility as a caretaker .\n",
      "S But with RFID tags , their children can remain safe and sound by lowering the case of being injured or lost as the devices can detect straightaway if such situations happen .\n",
      "S Therefore , RFID tags are efficacious devices in monitoring the situation of children .\n",
      "S Surveillance technology such as RFID also plays a pivotal role in health field .\n",
      "S Currently , a number of hospitals have begun to implement the attachment of RFID tags on patients in order to monitor and observe the patients from time to time .\n",
      "S It was also stated by Information Week ( 2005 ) , that RFID tags can be used to prevent newborn infants from being abducted by outsiders .\n",
      "S The tagging system is also a measure to deter the problems of having Alzheimer patients lost wandering at other places or patients collapsing outside of hospital area .\n",
      "S Signals will be transmitted to the hospital to alert the nurses of their condition .\n",
      "S Hence , with such surveillance technology , the risk of patients getting injured while getting lost outside can be reduced to a minimal percentage .\n",
      "S All in all , it can not be denied that surveillance technology is important in securing a safe environment .\n",
      "S The impact of surveillance technology towards human lives is huge and can be frightening at times .\n",
      "S Moreover , the public has generated concern over the right of keeping their personal information in private .\n",
      "S Even though there are doubts and concerns towards the usage of surveillance technology for tracking purposes , it is still a central piece of the puzzle of human lives .\n",
      "S In a nutshell , surveillance technology such as RFID tags used to track people should not be banned .\n",

      "S Topic 1 : \" The use of surveillance technology such as RFID to track people should be banned .\n",
      "S \"\n",
      "S The competitive world has caused technologies to improve rapidly in the 21st century .\n",
      "S One of the advancement in technology would be surveillance technology .\n",
      "S The concerns for safety and security have increased the number of use of the surveillance systems .\n",
      "S Despite the proper usage of surveillance technology , there is a widespread abuse of the technology by some criminal organization .\n",
      "S Hence , the potential for abuse increases .\n",
      "S Surveillance technology has been used as a tool for illegitimate activities which in turn threatens publics ' safety and security .\n",
      "S This issue has become a main topic in public discussion .\n",
      "S Thus , due to the risk of misuse of surveillance technology , I fully concur that the use of surveillance technology should be banned .\n",
      "S First and foremost , surveillance technology such as Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) has been used as a tool for hackers and identity thieves to commit \" 'contactless ' \" crime against victims without their consent ( Lewan , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S RFID chip is largely used in some official identification documents such as driver 's license and passport in America .\n",
      "S Once the RFID number is intercepted , it is possible for the criminals to track the movements of their targets without their knowledge .\n",
      "S Additionally , it has been concluded that the use of RFID has no benefit on the achievement or national security , but it resulted in an increment in risk of personal privacy and security ( Lewan , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , the use of RFID should be disregarded .\n",
      "S Secondly , online behavioral tracking is another main issue of how surveillance technology has been misused .\n",
      "S It tracks users ' online activities and collects their electronic information and makes the information available to parties other than their initial correspondents without their consent ( Report on Consumer Watchdog ; Consumer and Privacy Groups Urge Congress to Enact Consumer Privacy Guarantees , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , the consumers ' privacy is invaded .\n",
      "S The online behavioral tracking can also be used to target vulnerable consumers for deceitful advertisement .\n",
      "S Thus , the security of the consumers is at high risk .\n",
      "S Thirdly , the improper use of this surveillance technology will bring about the consequence of privacy invasion .\n",
      "S Different people define privacy differently .\n",
      "S An anonymous author once defines privacy as \" 'the claim of individuals , groups , or institutions to determine for themselves how , when and to what extent information about them is communicated to others ' \" ( Bogonikolos and Holdsworth ( Ed .\n",
      "S ) . , 1999 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , everyone has the right to protect their privacy .\n",
      "S In conclusion , surveillance technology should be banned as it has been misused by people for illegal activities .\n",
      "S The misuse of surveillance technology not only invades user 's privacy but also increases the risk of personal and national security .\n",

      "S Genetic testing allows early detection of diseases which may be useful to mankind .\n",
      "S However , genetic testing has brought about issues if such genetic results are revealed and abused .\n",

      "S There is tension between employees and employer regarding genetic testing .\n",
      "S ( Stephen , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S If genetic testing indicates susceptibility for diseases of an employee , there is chance that the employer will sack the employee .\n",
      "S This is supported by the fact that most people with disabilities or diseases are discriminated .\n",
      "S Most companies are not willing to employ them as they may be seen to be inefficient because of their disabilities .\n",
      "S Thus , genetic results should not be revealed to protect people from losing their jobs .\n",
      "S Opponents of this position may argue that such results should be revealed to protect employer from an employee vulnerable to illness .\n",
      "S ( Stephen , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S However , the primary aim of employment should be work performance and efficiency , rather than on genetic testing .\n",
      "S ( Kankowski & Capron,1991 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , individual should have the final say to protect them from environment that may harm them .\n",
      "S ( Stephen , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Next , a further difficulty issue involves revealing of genetic results to insurance companies .\n",
      "S ( Stephen , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S Applicants will be at a disadvantage when applying for insurance .\n",
      "S For example , if genetic results are revealed , the cost of the insurance will be expensive such that it may not be worth it .\n",
      "S Critics of this position claim that insurer will also be at a disadvantage if such results are not revealed to them .\n",
      "S ( Stephen , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S I must admit that the insurer will be at a disadvantage if the situation is switched .\n",
      "S However , the cost of insurance should be on the current medical status of the applicant and should not be on the results of the genetic testing .\n",
      "S In conclusion , I believe that the individual requesting genetic testing should have the final say in whether to reveal the results of such testing as it will affect both the relationship between employees and employer and issues involving insurance .\n",

      "S With rapid technological advancement , myriad forms of surveillance technology have surfaced and people are using it both intensively and extensively .\n",
      "S From forms as high level as satellite surveillance to the common Radio Frequency Identification Device ( RFID ) , surveillance technology has served us well .\n",
      "S However , due to the improper exploit of it , surveillance technology has become more of detrimental than beneficial .\n",
      "S Intrusion of privacy and upsetting the various balances in society are concerns people are increasingly worried about .\n",
      "S Hence , with so much discomfort people are experiencing with surveillance technology , it should be banned .\n",
      "S Due to the immense usage of surveillance technology , the society has become relatively transparent .\n",
      "S On the intangible aspects , information of individuals can be easily retrieved with the ease of data mining ( Easton , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S With high speed connections and data transfer rate nowadays , an enormous bulk of data can be moved around in a very short period .\n",

      "S Unfortunately , there is pro and con among the public about the disclosure of the result of genetic testing , whether it should be revealed or not .\n",
      "S Then , who will be the one who holds the right to do it ?\n",
      "S On one side , some people think that the individual who requests it has the final say for the revelation .\n",
      "S On the other hand , others reason that the genetic inheritance is something that is quite crucial , thus it should be discussed with the family first before reaching the final decision .Therefore , the final say does not only depend on one person but also his relatives .\n",
      "S Genetic testing will bring about many consequences .\n",
      "S First , by doing genetic testing , people may be able to discover about their genetic disease early .\n",
      "S For instance , a man , who actually has Huntington 's disease and one day he takes the genetic testing , will then find out the truth about his condition .\n",
      "S This outcome will certainly affect all of his family as Huntington 's is a genetic disease .\n",
      "S ( American Society of Clinical Oncology , 2006 ) Due to the broader effects that may present , people should discuss with their family first before deciding on something .\n",
      "S Second , some people argue that genetic testing is a privacy and sensitive problem .\n",
      "S In addition , the result may be embarrassing and can affect their prestige .\n",
      "S For example , a man has mutation in his gene and the result states that he is actually a woman .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is understandable that he should have the final say to reveal the result or hold it ( Wertz , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S However , in the reality , the result of genetic testing is so important and could give impact to all his family as it may comprise information about hereditary disease .\n",

      "S Over the years , genetic testing has become more available to the public .\n",
      "S An individual can request and afford to undergo genetic testing to find out whether or not his body houses a defective gene .\n",
      "S When the results of the test is given to the individual , the question of whether the results should be revealed or not arises .\n",
      "S Although the individual may feel that he should have the final say on the revelation of the results , in fact , having the physicians decide whether the results should be revealed would be much more beneficial to the society and the individual himself .\n",
      "S Therefore , the individual should not have the final say on whether the results of such testing should be revealed .\n",
      "S Firstly , the physician is in a better position to decide if the results should be revealed .\n",
      "S This is due to the physician being more knowledgeable about the results , especially if a defective gene is detected in the individual .\n",
      "S The individual is unlikely to reveal their results to their family , potential and current employers , insurance companies for fear of discrimination from them ( Centre for Genetics Education , June 2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , by doing so , he is actually putting his family at risk as they will not know whether they too carry the defective gene which would put them at a higher risk of developing the disease associated with the gene ( Centre for Genetics Education ) .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the physician would not be able to determine if the defective gene is hereditary and whether the other family members have that gene or not .\n",
      "S Secondly , for his own reasons , such as family disputes , the individual may choose not to act responsibly and withhold the results from family members .\n",
      "S In such cases , the physician would have the right to reveal the results to the family of the individual , especially if the test results indicate that the defective gene is present , there is the possibility that others in the family has the gene as well .\n",
      "S Also , with regards to the problem of discrimination , which is the underlying factor for the individual not wanting to reveal the results , there are laws in place in many countries that states that it is against the law to discriminate against people who have tested positive for a particular defective gene .\n",
      "S The physicians also have their medical code of conduct that states information about the patient is confidential unless it poses threat to others ( American Journal of Obstetrics , May 2008 ) .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the individual requesting genetic testing should not have the final say as to whether the results should be revealed or not as the benefits of revealing the results is substantial to the individual and his family , and it can not be assumed that the individual will be able to act responsibly to his family in the face of his own interests .\n",

      "S As a type of surveillance technology , RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification ) is drawing increasing attention and has caused many conflicts on the privacy , security and health issues .\n",

      "S Hence , the use of RFID to track people should be banned .\n",

      "S Firstly , the abuse of RFID invades privacy .\n",
      "S It is hard to guarantee that every racking is innocent and conducted in proper ways and .\n",
      "S For example , overzealous employers and criminally intent people could take advantage of the RFID readers to track employees and victims ' movement ( Jean 2007 ) .\n",
      "S In this case , victims may lose their privacy even without awareness .\n",
      "S Secondly , because a RFID embedded card is easily to be skimmed and cloned , to some extent , it is a loophole for identity theft .\n",
      "S Using the cloned card , anyone could pass into a restricted area through the secure and locked entrance ( Jones 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , using RFID equipped card to track and control entrance is not secure and effective at all .\n",
      "S Thirdly , implantable RFID chips have connections with health issues .\n",
      "S Research showed that \" implanted RFID chips caused cancer in mice and rats and may cause cancer in cats , dogs , and humans \" ( Jean 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Additionally , \" although an RFID chip in particular may not cause cancer , the inflammation caused by surgical implantation of a foreign object can increase the instance of tumor development \" ( Jean 2007 ) .\n",
      "S According to these , there is no way to sacrifice people 's health to conduct tracking for any purpose .\n",
      "S However , RFID advocators may declare some arguments for the purpose of alleviating the fear of privacy invasion .\n",
      "S For instance , the reader needs to be within about ten feet of the chip in order to extract data , so it may not handle long-range tracking ( Jean 2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , it is still highly undetectable if the reader is installed inside doors or walls .\n",
      "S Furthermore , within such distance , RFID readers could still function ( Jean 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , people are still under the risk of being tracked and losing privacy without knowledge .\n",

      "S Hence this predictive power leads to one of the many controversies- should the individual have the final say in whether to reveal his/her results ?\n",
      "S Because the results could potentially be used to save lives , yet at the same time be misused , the individual requesting the test should not have the final say .\n",

      "S Firstly , the physician is a profession that is bounded with standard protocols and most importantly the physician possesses medical ethics .\n",
      "S As the genetics results also apply to the family and relatives ' health risks other than the patient 's own , many lives are concerned and any unjustifiable reason not to disclose should be overwritten .\n",
      "S The American Society of Human Genetics even propose conditions whereby patient autonomy should be disregarded ( Bioethics Advisory Committee,2005 ) , emphasizing importance of disclosure of results .\n",

      "S Moreover , the mental preparedness of the patient is most likely moulded on the pre-test counselling before genetics testing is carry out .\n",

      "S In order to ease the aging process such that the elderly can aged without being neglected and also in comfort , research and development and policies have been implemented .\n",
      "S To a large extent , these have helped to ease the aging process through investing in healthcare for elderly , giving financial aids to the elderly and also enhancing the psychological well being of the elderly .\n",
      "S Firstly , Governments are setting aside more funds for healthcare to meet the growing demand of the elderly .\n",
      "S In Singapore , $ 4 billion was committed over 5 years to expand the healthcare infrastructure which includes redevelopment of older hospitals and also building of 2 new hospitals .\n",
      "S ( Government of Singapore , 10 February 2009 ) Healthcare professionals like nurses are also trained to be able to handle more complicated procedures as compared to the past ( The straits times , 17 August 2009 ) .This provide quality healthcare for elderly in a high standard of living environment .\n",
      "S It may be costly to implement these policies but it is necessary as in future the aging population is projected to soar .\n",
      "S In Japan , it is expensive to create and own a nurse robot but it is necessary as in future there will be lack of human resources to take care of the elderly .\n",
      "S ( James Brooke , 5 March 2004 ) Such technology will allow elderly to be self equipped to take care of themselves which is vital in current competitive society where their children will be overload with work to take care of them .\n",
      "S Secondly , the financial aids come up by the policies makers also manage to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Governments help to reduce the burden of the elderly by subsidizing healthcare , giving financial aid and also enforcing the people to save for retirement .\n",
      "S In Singapore , elderly are entitled to a subsidy of 75 per cent of the fees charged at polyclinics and even free medical service for frail or disabled elderly .\n",
      "S ( Government of Singapore , 10 February 2009 ) However , some may argue that the financial benefits may still be inadequate as elderly may need long term medical treatment and take longer time to recover .\n",
      "S Also , elderly may abuse the medical services when it is provided through financial aid .\n",
      "S Thus , to counter these problems there is also the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) which consists of compulsory medical savings in Medisave , health insurance in MediShield and government aid in Medifund to make the people save for their own retirement .\n",
      "S ( Government of Singapore , 10 February 2009 ) This will lighten the financial burden of the elderly easing the aging process as they can retire with more security and less worries .\n",
      "S In addition , enhancing the psychological well being of the elderly can make aging less depressing and cultivates a pleasant lifestyle for the elderly thus making the aging process more enjoyable .\n",
      "S There are policies like revising the retirement age from 65 to 67 in United States ( U.S. Social Security Administration , 1 April 2009 ) and also in Taiwan from 60 to 65 .\n",
      "S ( The China Post news staff , 19 April 2008 ) This allows older age group to continue to contribute to the economy and feel useful .\n",
      "S There are also retraining and upgrading programs , like the { Senior Community Service Employment Program } [ HYPERLINK : http : //www.doleta.gov/seniors/ ] initiated by the United States Department of Labor ( U.S. Department of Labor , Employment & Training Administration ( ETA ) , 13 Jan 2009 ) , to make them be as competent as the young people making the elderly still feel young at heart .\n",
      "S These will have positive effects on the mental health of the elderly , easing the aging process .\n",
      "S Although it may be difficult to totally change the mindset of the elderly as aging will wear them out , these policies at least allow the elderly to not feel like a burden to the society .\n",
      "S Moreover , these policies will give the older aged group more choices for choosing the kind of lifestyles they want .\n",
      "S If they prefer a relaxing aging process , they can also engage in activities in the community centre which will also enhance their mental well being and ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , Critics of this position point out that there are also policies that have not helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S This is particularly the case for policies that tackle on increasing birth rate .\n",
      "S By increasing birth rate , there will be more productive population who can generate income to support the future aging population .\n",
      "S For example , the baby bonus scheme in Singapore was ineffective as the birth rate remains at 1.28 .\n",
      "S The attractive financial incentives like getting cash gift of up to $ 4,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $ 6,000 each for having a 3rd and 4th child and also paid maternity leave of 4 months were not enough to make people wants to have more children .\n",
      "S This can be due to lifestyle of Singaporeans like having long working hours and high standard of living , thus they prefer not to have any children .\n",
      "S As long as government considers solution to these issues like encouraging working from home , the policy may be more effective .\n",
      "S If these policies were successful , it will definitely ease the aging process .\n",
      "S In conclusion , current policies have helped to ease the aging process in many different areas .\n",
      "S In the coming years , more countries will also be facing this problem and thus different types of research and development as well as policies should be explored to prepare for the future .\n",

      "S There should be a limit on public spending on the aged so that money could be diverted to other areas of the country 's development ( Peterson , 2001 ) is a suggestion that should be implemented in order to combat the rising cost of healthcare for the elderly .\n",
      "S With the rapid growth of the elderly population for example in a country like Singapore , where the median age is expected to hit 41 years old from the present 36 ( Wijaya , 2009 ) , increasing public spending in healthcare could further strain the government 's expenditure as more money need to be poured in to cater to the growing numbers of elderly in the country .\n",
      "S There are several factors that explains the need to limit public spending on elderly healthcare .\n",
      "S Government needs to focus the spending on more important sectors first like economic development before worrying about healthcare for the elderly .\n",
      "S As Friedland and Summer ( 2005 ) suggested , with more economic growth , the country will be able to have more choices and more resources to invest into the elderly healthcare sector .\n",
      "S This move will be beneficiary in the long run as it does not only ensure that the country is progressing economically , it is also securing a brighter future for the healthcare sector as more money could be spent on it in the long run .\n",
      "S In contrast , if the government decides to cut back spending on economic development and rather channel it into the elderly healthcare sector , tougher choices like tax increase have to be made in the future if the economic development is unable to sustain the rise in healthcare spending .\n",
      "S For example , assume that the government has 100 dollars and it has 2 choices of either investing it for 2 times the return or spending it on healthcare .\n",
      "S Assume that the government decides to invest all of the 100 dollars at first and gets 200 dollars in return .\n",
      "S The government can now choose to allocate some money into healthcare , invest the remaining money and as time goes by , not only the government will be earning more profits but the healthcare will be getting bigger allocation .\n",
      "S However , should the government decides to spend all of the 100 dollars into healthcare , there will be no profits and the government will also suffer a deficit .\n",
      "S Secondly , public spending on elderly healthcare should only be limited to elderly who really need it to prevent abuse by other citizens .\n",
      "S If there are no limits implemented , the normal citizens could abuse the system by using it indiscriminately and denying the rights of healthcare to truly needy patients .\n",
      "S An example could be seen in the United Kingdom where healthcare is fully subsidized by the government .\n"

      "S Ageing population is a serious problem faced by many developed state .\n",
      "S It is mainly caused by the increased number of elderly and the drop in birth rate .\n",
      "S The ageing population is creating many social problems such as health problems , high government expenses and high income taxis , which are stressing the young workers and the aged people .\n",
      "S Many states such as the US , the UK , Japan and Singapore start to implement various policies such as increasing child birth rate , saving plans for elderly and health care policies to ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S However , most of these policies tend to be ineffective in easing the ageing process because they either have their limitation or fail to solve the social problems behind the ageing process .\n",
      "S This essay is going to examine the limitation and the problem ignored by those current policies .\n",
      "S Health care policies can be found in many developed countries in easing the ageing process to a very limited extent , because they creates social burden and fail to service minorities most of the time .\n",
      "S For example , the UK has tried to make the nation to become welfare state , but this leaves heavy tax burden to the working class and created low working incentive for the workers .\n",
      "S It shows that medical policies must be planned well to provide health care to people who really need it .\n",
      "S For example , Japan has introduced medical service , which allows its citizens to save for their personal medical account so that we can use the money when they fall sick in their old age .\n",
      "S Similarly , Singapore has introduced same kind of policies call Medi-save and Medi-shield .\n",
      "S However , these policies can not help those people who have long term disease because these diseases requires huge amount of money to cure .\n",
      "S Ironically , the World Health Organization has released a report in year 2006 which showed that the number of people who have long term disease such as heart disease and cancer is increasing sharply .\n",
      "S The data has also showed that stressful working life is contributing to the poor health of the people .\n",
      "S Moreover , the minorities who do not have proper job or income do not have a medical care account will not be taken care by the health service .\n",
      "S They will be having nothing to rely when they fall sick .\n",
      "S Therefore , the health care policy in most developed countries should be improved to help those patients with long term disease and those who are neglected .\n",
      "S The baby bonus policy also has its limitation in easing the ageing process through increasing the birth rate to support the elderly .\n",
      "S Today , both two leading states such as Japan and Singapore in the area of slowing down the ageing population have implemented \" Baby Bonus Policy \" .\n",
      "S Basically , families that give birth to more than one child will get economic support from child birth rate and ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S This is because the fact that many elderly couples only have one child to breed them and this always puts a heavy burden to the child .\n",
      "S Hence , with more children , more economic support could be provided and the old parents could be taken care better .\n",
      "S However , the \" Baby Bonus Policy \" does not work well although almost everyone aware its benefit .\n",
      "S For example , Singapore 's birth rate is 1.28 , which is the lowest in the world .\n",
      "S This is because firstly , the stressful social environment that forces couples to put their time and effort in their work , so that they are unable to spend time with each other .\n",
      "S Secondly , getting more salary through longer working hours makes life much easier than appealing for limited economic aids after having many children .\n",
      "S Thus , government fails to notice the two root of the evil .\n",
      "S Therefore , baby bonus policy could not increase the birth rate effectively in easing ageing process .\n",
      "S The modern society today is fulfilled with modern values that lead to the ageing population , thus caused the some government policies to become ineffective in easing the ageing process .\n",
      "S Many states have introduced housing policies , which allow the young couples to live near their parents or giving priority in purchasing house to those people who have married .\n",
      "S This allows the couples to take care each other especially when they are old , or to take care their parents when they are still young .\n",
      "S However , the states fail to realize that people 's value towards family is changing today .\n",
      "S The family bonding in most western society is very weak and the young generation does not really have a sense of filial piety in their head .\n",
      "S Also , the stressful working market created by capitalism today is taking away too much time and effort from people so that they can not spend them with their family , or even can not think of having a family .\n",
      "S It creates modern value that allows people of opposite sex to live together without having a family .\n",
      "S So , what if people do not get married ?\n",
      "S What if the idea of family is vanished ?\n",
      "S What if the young no longer care about their parents ?\n",
      "S If all these assumptions occurred , the housing policy therefore will not be relevant at all .\n",
      "S Hence , besides housing policies , the governments should also raise the awareness of having strong family bonding .\n",
      "S In conclusion , most of the current policies in easing ageing process have their limitation or ineffective .\n",
      "S The fundamental problem is because the states fail to realize the social problems behind , which contributed to the stressful ageing process .\n",

      "S However , the figures have each increased to 67 and 78 , and it has no signs of stopping .\n",

      "S Despite these measures , the birth rate of Singapore has not increase significantly ( Mui Teng Yap , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S The \" Stop at two \" policy had been so successful that couples in Singapore saw that they can have a better standard of living with a smaller family .\n",

      "S For instance , in Malaysia by paying your parents medical bill , you are able to claim up to RM1000 .\n",
      "S This is a government policy to encourage filial piety .\n",
      "S However , this raises an implication that the upper class and middle class people who are likely more easily to access information will use this advantage .\n",
      "S This , in turn will create a misguide impression that medical fees of the elderly are high , resulting in the debate between the government and policy makers whether to limit healthcare spending on the aged or not .\n",

      "S Public spending on the aged\n",
      "S Over the last 50 years aging population was considered as a big problem that influenced western countries economic development .\n",
      "S However , during the next 50 years there will be a dramatic increase in aged and it is inevitable for Asian countries to face this challenge from now on .\n",
      "S To date , aging population whose age is above 5 comprise 14 percent of the world .\n",
      "S According to the survey done by United Nations , aging population in Asia is estimated to increase by 314 percent , from 207 million to 857 million in 2050 and among those sub regions East Asia will suffer most .\n",
      "S Japan is still the country with largest amount of and most rapidly growing aging population .\n",
      "S Both china and Singapore are anticipated to become the second right after Japan in 30 years and aged above 65 will make up 20 percent of the total population .\n",
      "S Moreover , the rate of birth kept falling down and family will have less adult children than they had in the past , which puts more burdens together with aging population to the government to deal with .\n",
      "S So it has been a controversial issue that whether government shall cut public spending on the aged and divert to other areas of economic development to secure stable productivity and GDP .\n",
      "S It looks aging population will become a worse problem if current low-level government spending is going to be cut further .\n",
      "S However , taking all the advantages and disadvantages of this policy from the angle of the future into account , there will be more effective ways to handle this challenge rather than directly or indirectly giving \" fish \" to the elderly , so it will be necessary for the government to limit public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S There is not dispute that the average age is climbing up continuously as it is impossible to prevent people from getting old , which is the most outstanding but only one part of the features of aging population .\n",
      "S It is more important to pay attention to other trends and characteristics of aging population in order to solve this problem it in some other ways .\n",
      "S One of the biggest factors that the aged may causes excessive burden on economic development is the less support to the family from their adult children as a consequence of less birth rate and higher child bring-up fees .\n",
      "S For example , there has been a baby booming period between 1947 and 1949 in Japan but since 1949 the total fertility rate started to fall , from 4.54 to 2.04 per woman in less than 10 years and from 2.14 to only 1.29 nowadays .\n",
      "S The same kind of situation is also confronted by Singapore , china , Thailand , South Korean and other Asian countries .\n",
      "S On the other hand , the number of adult children who are willing to live with their parents fell instead of rising .\n",
      "S The proportion of Japanese elderly people living with their adult children fell from 80 percent in 1950 to 50 percent in 1990 ( Onawa and Rather 1997 ) , in south Korean from 78 percent in 1984 to 47 percent in 1994 ( Weinstein et al.1994 ) .\n",
      "S Thus it will be more essential for the government to emphasize the responsibility that adult children bear to support the family rather than directly give financial support to the aged , which will in turn lay more tax burdens on the working group .\n",
      "S In other words , making the adult children actively support their parents will be better than passively pay tax .\n",
      "S In some relatively politically stable regions like Singapore , it is good for the government to enact the laws for the adult children to provide family support .\n",
      "S In addition to getting support from adult children , it is identically important to give more employment opportunities or put off the mandatory retirement ages for the elderly , which is also a good method to ease the rapid productivity downturn as people tend to live longer than before .\n",
      "S Similar to the problem of adult children , although the number of aging population keeps rising , the amount of old people who could get chance to work either full time or part time tends to fall due to economic and social changes that less employers want to hire old labor - from 38 percent of the population 65 and above in 1950 to 25 percent in 2000 and 22 percent in 2010 by the survey from United Nations .\n",
      "S This opposite direction of number of aged and working group affects the economic productivity to a great extent .\n",
      "S So the government 's task is to make more policies concerning both the mandatory retirement age and employers ' restriction .\n",
      "S For instance , hiring the elderly as part-time worker may be a good choice for both aged and employers so as to enable the elderly to earn more as well as enhance productivity .\n",
      "S This is also a good way to let the aging population take , if not all , part of the public spending by themselves .\n",
      "S Due to the fact that it may not be very realistic for those people who are already very old , disabled or need much medical care to be very productive , some other ways shall be combined to handle aging population .\n",
      "S Among them public housing policies and public pensions are good choices of public spending but simultaneously also cost the government a great deal .\n",
      "S Both Singapore 's and Japan 's pension scheme cover all of the work force , which sets great financial burden upon their government .\n",
      "S Although it 's useful in short term to stabilize aged , with the surprising speed of growth of aging population , it will be more difficult for government to sustain this policy and in some other countries such as Indonesia , India , Philippines where the political system is not stable or the demographic structure is mainly made up of low-income working class like china these policies would not be effective .\n",
      "S And in a country with pay-as-you-go system like Japan there will definitely be some problem in the future if government does not stop spending more on public pension as the number of retirees becomes larger and larger relative to the number of employees .\n",
      "S More taxes will also be conducted to future generation .\n",
      "S So the best way to cope with this problem will be encouraging nowadays working force to save more money for themselves instead of depending on their descendants or government .\n",
      "S Basically set up a healthier financial saving system according to different period the different economic situation with proper interest rate and bonus .\n",
      "S Apart from the methods mentioned above , there are more and more effective methods to be come up with to handle aging population instead of direct public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S The elderly is a large part of the society that can not be ignored and the best way to keep a sustainable economic development as well as give them a beautiful autumn is to set up a systematic methodology rather than focus on any single policy .\n",
      "S One of the major concerns of Singapore is its increasing aging population .\n",
      "S Today the median age in Singapore is 36 years .\n",
      "S By the year 2050 , our median age would be 54 years .\n",
      "S ( Lee , 2009 ) .The government have been taking the challenge of easing the aging process very seriously .\n",
      "S To a large extent , the government 's policies have helped to ease the aging process particularly through economic policies , infrastructure and healthcare .\n",
      "S In the economic sector , the government have implemented the Central Provision Fund ( CPF ) to ensure that the elderly would be financially capable to support themselves when they retire .\n",
      "S The CPF savings are entirely invested in special government bond which are risk free and has long term interest rate.CPF have been a major source of financial supplement for most of the retired elderly .CPF ensures that all working Singaporeans have a saving that is set aside to support their needs when they retire .\n",
      "S However the government also realises that the CPF savings might not be sufficient for aging needs hence to help enhance the function of CPF , the government is adding an annuity scheme known as the CPF LIFE ( Lifelong Income For The Elderly ) that will provide a secure stream of income for the elderly .\n",
      "S ( Lee,2009 ) .This is done when Singaporeans reach the age of 55 , part of their CPF savings will be transferred into an annuity which will provide a steady stream of income from the age of 65 for life.CPF is a mandatory saving scheme and therefore it ensures that the elderly will have the financial means to support their aging process .\n",
      "S The government have also been legislating laws that require employers to offer re-employment to their workers until the age of 65.This is a flexible approach because the workers do not have to get the same job or pay .\n",
      "S The government have incorporated this approach from Japan because it is a pragmatic step compared to just increasing the official retirement age .\n",
      "S By encouraging re- employment , the government is assisting the elderly to lead an active and productive life .\n",
      "S Life-long employability also helps the elderly to accumulate more wealth so that they can support themselves .\n",
      "S However most employers would prefer hiring younger working adults because they are more productive compared to the elderly .\n",
      "S To tackle this issue the government have introduced the Workfare Income Supplement which is a negative income tax and it is weighted in favour of older workers .\n",
      "S Workers above the age of 50 also pay lower CPF contribution to decrease the cost of hiring them .\n",
      "S These steps have increased the employment rate of older workers .\n",
      "S In addition to that , the government have various programs to retrain older workers and improve their skills .\n",
      "S ( Lee , 2009 )\n",
      "S The healthcare sector has also contributed in helping to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The national health care expenditure have been kept at 4 % of Singapore 's gross domestic profit ( GDP ) ( Lee,2009 ) Although healthcare expenditure will inevitably rise in the coming years , the government have introduced the 3M that will help the needy in their healthcare expenditure .\n",
      "S The 3M are MediSave , MediShield and MediFund.The introduction of these 3M have helped the elderly in financing their healthcare .\n",
      "S On top of the 3M , the government have also introduced Eldershield which is an insurance scheme that gives financial protection to those who need long-term care , especially during old age .\n",
      "S Eldershield policy holders can claim benefits at any age for the rest of their life .\n",
      "S ( Ministry of Health ) In any event where the elderly becomes severely disabled , they can get a monthly cash payout .\n",
      "S To ensure that every elderly gets medical attention , the government have built new hospitals such as Jurong National Hospital and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital to accommodate more patients .\n",
      "S The government is also building step down care sectors which includes more community hospitals , nursing homes and home care centres to provide better elderly care .\n",
      "S However these services are currently only provided by voluntary welfare organisations and they need more government support .\n",
      "S The government is aware of this situation and they have come up with a solution to overcome this problem by linking up acute hospitals with community ones .\n",
      "S This allows patients to recuperate at community hospitals and make room for more serious medical condition to be treated in acute hospitals .\n",
      "S This is an effective solution because the role of caring for the elderly is divided as effectively as possible between the private and government sectors .\n",
      "S To ensure better comfort for the elderly , the government have also been upgrading home care to serve the elderly better .\n",
      "S ( Channel News Asia , 2008 )\n",
      "S The government have also upgraded infrastructure to help ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Upgraded infrastructure helps the mobilization of the elderly .\n",
      "S The Housing and Development Board have been building more studio apartments to accommodate senior citizen .\n",
      "S ( Lee , 2009 ) .New lifts have been installed in every floor of apartments and flats .\n",
      "S The bus system is also improved by making buses wheelchair accesible.The trains in Singapore are already wheelchair assessable .\n",
      "S The government have also gone beyond transportation and housing to help ease the aging process by providing neighbourhoods with decent public toilets and green spaces which enables the elderly to lead an active lifestyle .\n"

      "S In this essay , we will be addressing these dilemmas and attempt to propose several possibilities as well as solutions that come with it .\n",

      "S \" [ 1 ] Suffice to say , limiting public spending on the elderly must be considered in order to maintain a sustainable economy .\n",

      "S Certain categories fall through the gaps of the system and are left dry and powerless , even without the basic needs .\n",
      "S An example could be seen in the following article which writes \" Is n't the HDB 's policies self-contradictory , when it 's income ceiling policy 'forces ' the lower-income to buy larger flats than they can afford... HDB 's income eligibility requires a household earning more than $ 2,000 a month to buy a flat that is bigger than a two-room flat... a household earning just over $ 3,000 , is also not eligible to buy a three-room flat , and have to buy a four-room flat .\n",

      "S It does n't necessarily mean that when one has some money , he/she does n't need help .\n",
      "S Spending on the aged should also be contextualized accordingly with economic situations , such as the recent economic crisis where employers are extremely selective , making jobs all the more scarce for the elderly .\n",
      "S Clearly , it can be seen that though limiting public spending on the elderly might produce certain immediate difficulties , it will ease the process inevitably during the long run .\n",
      "S It is important that for us to maintain economic stability , we should keep our sights focused on a more macro scale .\n",

      "S Thus , the rise of the silver population poses various political , economic and social challenges globally .\n",
      "S Governments often rack their brains to come up with the best solutions in terms of policies and research and developments .\n",
      "S The social policies that have been implemented in Singapore include the Baby Bonus Scheme to encourage bigger family size , raising the legal retirement age to lengthen work span , and the Parents ' Maintenance Act to impose filial piety .\n",
      "S Although these policies seek to ease the aging process , they are starting to show signs of weakness when viewed from a long term perspective .\n",
      "S One of the policies introduced by the government in tackling the aging population is the Baby Bonus Scheme .\n",
      "S However , despite being implemented for several years , the scheme has yet to produce satisfying results .\n",
      "S This is because many young Singaporeans are now leading a different lifestyle and adopting different ideologies about the concept of marriage and family .\n",
      "S For example , some of them do not see the need of having babies and viewed it as a potential source of problem to their ever-stressful life .\n",
      "S Also , many feel that the scheme is not attractive enough to offset the cost of having more babies .\n",
      "S With the relentless rising cost of living and competition , Singaporeans now have to work harder just to meet the ends .\n",
      "S Thus , many are put off by the idea of having more children due to the accompanying life- time commitment of raising a child .\n",
      "S Therefore , due to these worries , many couples are not responding to the scheme despite the continuous efforts made by the government .\n",
      "S To lengthen working lifespan , the government introduced policies to reduce elder dependency by raising eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .\n",
      "S However , depending entirely on legislation will not bring about substantial improvements in boosting employment prospects for the \" silver population \" .\n",
      "S For example , the employment rate for workers aged 55-64 was only 57 % in 2008 , a slow increase from 38 % in 1991 .\n",
      "S For those aged 65-69 , the employment rate was merely 27.5 % .\n",
      "S Thus , even if the legal retirement age was raised , it clearly produces limited results .\n",
      "S The main reason is that even if older workers want to work , the deciding factor still lies with the employers .\n",
      "S In fact , stipulating higher retirement age can have an adverse effect .\n",
      "S Employers now think twice before employing or retaining older workers due to the potential higher liability and costs such as retraining programs and insurance benefits .\n",
      "S As a result , employers tend to shut their doors to the older workers .\n",
      "S In line with the above efforts to tackle the graying population , the government introduced the Parents ' Maintenance Act in 1996 to impose on filial piety .\n",
      "S However , the government can not simply legislate filial piety .\n",
      "S Law alone can not be used to solve the problems that cause some children to abandon their parents .\n",
      "S In fact , the Act is likely to cause even more distress among children who are already overly burdened with the ever rising cost of living in Singapore .\n",
      "S Family ties may be further strained since the children are not taking care of their parents out willingness .\n",
      "S Also , the government will be seen as shirking its responsibility towards the elderly citizens by pushing the load of parental care to their children .\n",
      "S Taking it from the parents ' perspective , some of them may not even consider the Act as being abandoned by their children is regarded as a shameful matter .\n",
      "S These parents may want to protect their family 's name and want their children to take care of them out of gratitude instead of legal obligations .\n",
      "S Therefore , while it seems that the Act is based on well intentions , it is certainly not the solution to the root of the parents ' maintenance problem .\n",
      "S Clearly , the rise of the aging population brings about complex and multi- faceted challenges to the whole of society .\n",
      "S The government should first understand and address the changing mindset and values of today 's society towards problems created by the fast aging population before implementing the policies .\n",
      "S Merely depending on legislation will not help to improve the attitudes of the society towards the elderly significantly .\n",
      "S Instead , this will bring about further resentment and result in a strain of relationship between the young and the old .\n",
      "S In all , moving beyond law to enhance the perceptions of elderly is a more practical way to increase the ability and willingness of the society to coordinate with the government in tackling the \" grey tsunami \" .\n",
      "S With the growing population and various problems that the present governments face today , the governments are finding it tedious to balance the budget to ensure that all areas of development are being met .\n",
      "S No country or state is able to provide unlimited funding to the providence of the aged .\n",
      "S Besides this , there are also other areas of the country which require more monetary spending to ensure the future of the country such as Education and Research and Development ( R&D ) .\n",
      "S However , public spending on the aged should not take a backseat .\n",
      "S There should be a sum of money which is set aside for the welfare of the aged .\n",
      "S After all , they were once a pillar of the country and helped to perpetuate growth of the country economically .\n",
      "S Basically , from the moral viewpoint , regardless of race or religion , filial piety is an important moral value that should be inculcated into us .\n",
      "S By having the government to set the standard of caring for the elderly , the public should also share the economic burden of caring for the aged .\n",
      "S Thus , the society should be magnanimous in spending in areas of healthcare or recreational programs .\n",
      "S For example , pumping money into R&D of illnesses like dementia , osteoporosis and Parkinson 's disease will benefit the aged because these illnesses are more apparent as people grow old .\n",
      "S This prepares the medical sector to handle these illnesses .\n",
      "S The government could also conduct recreational programs such as medical talks on the possible health problems that could arise in the aged .\n",
      "S This will help the elderly to understand the causes and effects of these health problems which encourage them to adopt a healthy lifestyle that reduces the risks of contracting these illnesses .\n",
      "S Therefore , we should spend on the aged .\n",
      "S However , economic benefits will be minimal if the state decides to be a welfare state and compromises the economic development of the country .\n",
      "S Suppose a country were to provide full support to the elderly , other developments like education and public housing would be costly .\n",
      "S People will be discouraged to study and will be in a state of chaos as the standard of living is too high for people to cope .\n",
      "S Even though this policy largely benefits the elderly , the rest of the society will suffer .\n",
      "S If no money were diverted into education , the country will suffer economically as there will be insufficient \" intelligent \" resource to promote economic growth .\n",
      "S When there are few to sustain the high cost of maintaining the aged , the aged will eventually suffer .\n",
      "S It will be like a vicious cycle .\n",
      "S The situation will be made worse if the country faces declining birth rate such as Singapore .\n",
      "S There are lesser young people to support the aged .\n",
      "S This increases economic burden for them .\n",
      "S Therefore , unlimited spending on the aged would be clearly unthinkable .\n",
      "S It will be more realistic if a calculated amount of spending is being distributed to the aged .\n",
      "S Areas like education and R&D help to fuel the economy .\n",
      "S These two areas are considered to play key roles in the growth of a nation .\n",
      "S For example , in countries like Singapore where there is a lack of natural resources , with only human resource , it is important for most Singaporeans to be educated .\n",
      "S Having received education increases the probability of one being employed which helps to promote economical growth .\n",
      "S With economical growth , the standard of living will also increase for people living in Singapore .\n",
      "S Furthermore , Singapore depends largely on international trade for growth .\n",
      "S Exports in Singapore comprise of over 130 % of Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) ever since mid 1980s .\n",
      "S The main products being export out of Singapore are integrated circuits , computer parts and accessories .\n",
      "S Since export plays a significant role in contributing to the GDP of Singapore , a vast amount of finance should be diverted to R&D .\n",
      "S Therefore , by providing education and investment into R&D help generate capital for the country .\n",
      "S Economic growth leads to an increase in standard of living which benefits the whole society including the aged .\n",
      "S A budget should be set for the public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S In fact , the governments should adopt and develop appropriate systems and programs customized with respect to their cultural , economic and social context .\n",
      "S Furthermore , it is beneficial for governments to exchange pointers and assist one another in coping with the effects of greying population .\n",
      "S This help to ensure that majority will age with security .\n",
      "S Keeping the aged in mind , we must never neglect the future generations since they will be the ones who will support the nation .\n",
      "S Therefore , we should first cater the needs of the younger ones .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas that are of equal , or even greater , importance .\n",
      "S A substantial amount is spent on the elderly annually , and this sum of money can be put to other uses .\n",
      "S Maintaining and sustaining a country is not just about looking after the aged , but also in developing growing sectors of our nation .\n",
      "S Although it is essential for the government to spend on the graying population , there are , however , ways to minimize this spending , and this amount can then be used on other areas of the country 's growth and development , such as maintaining our country 's defense and improving the education system .\n",
      "S There are several ways to reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .\n",
      "S One of which is to emphasize the importance of filial piety among the younger generations of our society .\n",
      "S Abandoning our parents might not be illegal , but it is morally unacceptable .\n",
      "S Our parents are the ones who brought us up since young ; providing us with basic necessities , educating and grooming us to be a worthy person of society , and showering us with love and concern that all individuals need .\n",
      "S We should reciprocate their love and be responsible by looking after them when they need us the most .\n",
      "S What our society is weak in now is the culture of supporting our parents when they are old .\n",
      "S This moral value should be instilled in our people since young , and they will then understand the importance and accept the responsibility of looking after their aged parents .\n",
      "S There will not be an overnight improvement in our citizens ' attitudes and behaviours towards taking care of the elderly in the society .\n",
      "S Therefore , there is a need to provide constant and adequate education to heighten awareness in the people regarding this issue .\n",
      "S Furthermore , lengthening the working lifespan of our citizens might be another viable solution in dealing with an aging population .\n",
      "S This is , however , hard to achieve in our present day society as employers , given a choice , tend to avoid hiring the elderly as they are thought to be less productive when compared to younger workers .\n"

      "S In the framework of fast-aging population and the restricted national budgets which do not allow spending generously on the elderly , this limit should be maintained at an acceptable level which ensures that the aged 's basic needs such as food , clothing , housing , transportation and healthcare are met .\n",

      "S Let 's take a situation in which without sufficient support from the government , the aged become a burden to their families as an example .\n",
      "S In that case , if the fiscal costs on the aged are cut down to rise up the expenditures on the young generation , it can lead to the result that the money aimed to support one target in a family the youth - will be shared to partly meet two demands , the elder 's and the younger 's .\n",
      "S In other words , the purposes of investing in other areas of development by using money saved from fiscal cost on the aged can not be fully fulfilled .\n",
      "S In developing countries , declining the basic expenditures on the aged can lead to a worse situation .\n",

      "S One of the productive areas to invest is economy [ 1 ] since economic development helps to raise the national budgets and thus raise the public expenditures on the elderly .\n",
      "S Money earning from investigations into other areas of the economics should be partly used to support the aged not only to lessen the burden on the families or to fade away the picture of poverty from generations to generations , but also to ease the elderly 's lives .\n",
      "S The increasing size of the economy could be relatively limited , but it does allow the government to have more choices to take care of the aged in a better way .\n",

      "S Public funds can be gathered through taxes on the citizens and also tariffs on incoming trade items from other countries .\n",

      "S So should we abandon these people when they are not as strong and perspicacious as they were before ?\n",
      "S Basically , it is the moral responsibility of our society to do all its best to support the elderly even at the expense of other areas of the country 's development .\n",

      "S As the cost of living and healthcare has been increasing , these schemes are able to help reduce the financial burden for the aged .\n",

      "S Nowadays , nobody can deny that aging population is becoming one of the most serious problems to developed countries , including Singapore .\n",
      "S Recent researches have shown that the proportion of the country 's residents aged 65 and above can reach the number of 18.7 % in the next 20 years .\n",
      "S Population aging has become a cause of concern in the realm of financial issue to the government .\n",
      "S It seems inevitable that we must spend more on the aged .\n",
      "S But what are we getting for all that money ?\n",
      "S Should we limit the public spending on the aged so that the money can be inverted to other areas of the country 's development ?\n",
      "S Answers to these questions are not easy to find .\n",
      "S However , in my opinion , the public spending could be more productive if the government knows how to control the money spent on the aged and also how to invest for other areas of development .\n",
      "S Among several public spending on the aged , such as medical subsidies , public infrastructure , pension schemes , and financial aids , healthcare must be considered the most important sector .\n",
      "S As the healthcare costs now are getting more and more expensive , consequently , it becomes harder and harder for old poor people to fulfill their payment for the hospitals .\n",
      "S Based on the situation , some claim that government should automatically spend more and more on the aged , who deserve to be helped .\n",
      "S However , the national budget will come under pressure when growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer young persons , which leads to the question that \" Can we really afford so much health care for aging population , or are we heading toward a healthcare crisis in the near future ?\n",
      "S \" Once again , the answer is not easy to find .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , the budget for healthcare is not infinite , so , the government and policy makers must decide at which extent they would give healthcare cost to an individual , depending on his own financial capacity .\n",
      "S The government needs to know how to set limits on the healthcare budget for the elderly .\n",
      "S The second reason is that public spending is not the only solution to the problem of aging population .\n",
      "S Researchers and policy makers have made a lot of suggestions and strategies to help buffet the negative impact of aging population on our society .\n",
      "S Some of them are encouraging later retirement , raising more productive children , encouraging the elderly and their families to take more responsibility for their health , etc .\n",
      "S Therefore , instead of spending too much money on the aged , the government can think about realize some of these planning policies , or other possible policies to solve the problem .\n",
      "S Last but not least , Singapore must spend money on a large numbers of other essential areas of development , such as education , infrastructure , defense , investments.. .\n",
      "S These areas of development are all the key things that a country needs in order to become a developed one .\n",
      "S Without a good education system , there will not be a well-educated intellectual generation for the country .\n",
      "S Without good infrastructure , there will not be sufficient facility for the country to develop .\n",
      "S Without a good defense system , people will live in the danger of terrorism as well as of being invaded .\n",
      "S Therefore , these areas of development must be well invested .\n",
      "S Moreover , when all of these areas are well invested enough to fulfill all the requirements , the living standard of Singaporeans will increase , consequently , the aged will received more help and budget from the society , or they even earn more money to support themselves too .\n",
      "S In conclusion , Singapore , as well as many Europeans and North American countries , is facing the problem of aging population .\n",
      "S If we do not put enough effort to solve the problem right now , it will be a really big issue in the future .\n",
      "S As the problem is controversial and there are a lot of different opinions surrounding it , the government and the policy makers must know how to make the right decision to point out the best solution for the country .\n",
      "S The most essential thing is to think out of the box .\n",
      "S We always need to consider so many factors that affect our decision , such as do we have enough money to afford all the healthcare cost , or are there any other areas of the nation 's development that really need our investment .\n",
      "S Therefore , setting limits on the public spending on the aged , I think , is a much better and wiser choice .\n",
      "S Demographic changes have recently caused many controversial issues .\n",
      "S Among these , the increasing number of aged people as well as the decrease in fertility rate as a new way of living is such a challenge that the world has to face in the next decades .\n",
      "S It is definitely not out of public concerns , especially in developed countries like Germany or Japan , where the aged population will make up a large proportion soon .\n",
      "S Along with modernized society , the elderly is receiving more and more supports from the government , which is a strategy in social welfare development .\n",
      "S Ironically , these policies not only bring benefits for the old people but also partly have a negative impact upon the socioeconomic development of the country .\n",
      "S In other words , the public expenditures on the aged have created barriers which limit the improvement of other fields .\n",
      "S Therefore , this spending should be reconsidered carefully to avoid financial shortage on other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S As part of the effort to enhance the social welfare , a lot of schemes have been adopted and operated in recent years for the sake of the old population .\n",
      "S Truthfully , these policies are significantly beneficial to senior citizens especially with respect to health , a problem induced by the physical aging process .\n",
      "S Some intermediate and long-term care services like community hospitals , home medical or home nursing services and public subsidies in Singapore are perhaps good examples for supports from the government .\n",
      "S Some statistics have showed that the government expenditure on community development , youth and sports went up by about 57 % from 2005 to 2008 while that on health rose dramatically by 128 % ( 1 ) .\n",
      "S In reality , these below schemes certainly accounted for not a small scale in the increased public spending .\n",
      "S Thus , the growth in number of projects unconsciously puts heavier pressure on the government budget , which consequently creates an imbalance in expenses of different domains .\n",
      "S This spending , however , is likely to increase more and more in the next years .\n",
      "S Also , it is not all the government 's duties to take care of the elderly .\n",

      "S This will obviously help to reduce the expenditures by sharing the dependency burden between the government and its citizens .\n",

      "S In short , the government and policy makers had better come to a reasonable decision on all projects .\n",

      "S Although many may agree that public spending on the elderly should be limited , this will however creates an impact to the society and increases societal cost .\n",
      "S The limitation in public spending on the elderly may cause family members and individuals shoulder a bigger responsibility in taking care of the elderly .\n",
      "S In addition , some of those cost on the elderly will end up getting shifted back to the public sector through less direct and more expensive means .\n",
      "S For example , the rising cost of health spending for the elderly has taken its toll on them and many could not afford that .\n",
      "S Thus , family members may need to fork out their own money to support their elderly parents .\n",
      "S Consequently , conflict and argument among family members may occur in this matter .\n",

      "S With the decrease in public spending on the elderly , many elderly will come under pressure as they will have less financial dependency on others .\n",
      "S Subsidies on health care and treatment at community hospitals and nursing homes for the elderly for instance will be cut off hence leaving them to be self-supporting .\n",
      "S All this pressure occur will make them suffer from mental illness as their children do not look after them in old age .\n",
      "S For most of the older people , family members are the major source of social and financial support .\n",

      "S All this will eventually lead to suicide and depression among the elderly .\n",
      "S On the whole , the government and society should support public spending for the elderly because the aged have in the past contributed to society and have made Singapore what it is today .\n",

      "S Many developed countries are now facing the same crucial issue an aging population .\n",
      "S Taking Singapore as an example , she will be witnessing a drastic demographic shift in history , with the age population ratio predicted to change drastically from one in twelve residents over the age of 65 in 2005 to one in five residents in 2030 ( Community on Ageing Issues , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , there would be a need for governments to increase expenditure on the aged to accommodate to this burgeoning age group .\n",
      "S Despite this , the crux of the issue here lies in how much should this spending on the aged be capped at .\n",
      "S For instance , health care now accounts for 4.5 % of Singapore 's gross national expenditure ( Wijaya , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S If there is no limit set to this figure , it can continue indefinitely , perhaps up to a double-digit figure , and may even cut into the state budget for other areas of development .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that there would be adequate resources available for other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S However , critics argued that by limiting the amount spent on the aged and diverting the resources to other areas of the country 's development , the essential needs of the elderly would be neglected .\n",
      "S One such example is the healthcare need of the elderly .\n",
      "S It would hardly be a surprise that healthcare cost for the elderly would continue to escalate in the decades ahead .\n",
      "S With the never-ending introduction of new medical technologies and the seriousness of prolonged illnesses associated with old age , medical treatments for the elderly would be increasingly expensive .\n",
      "S The limiting of the public spending on the aged would thereby shift more of this healthcare costs to the individuals , causing the elderly to shoulder heavier financial burden .\n",
      "S The elderly would therefore be at the suffering end .\n",
      "S While this may indeed happen , the situation can still be remedied .\n",
      "S Additional profits reaped from the investment in other areas of the country 's development could in turn contribute to the public spending significantly .\n",
      "S In fact , it is inevitable for the government to divert money to the other areas of development as aging population has affected these areas significantly .\n",
      "S One considerable implication of aging population is its possible impact on the country 's future macro-economic performance ( Schuiz , Borowoki , & Crown , 1991 ) .\n",
      "S As the baby boomers , the leading edge of the coming age wave , begin to move out of the workforce , the country will face the problem of a shrinking workforce .\n",
      "S In Singapore , there are currently 8.5 economically active persons to support one elderly .\n",
      "S By 2030 , the labour-dependency ratio will drastically drop to only 3.5 persons supporting one elderly ( Central Provident Fund [ CPF ] Board ) .\n",
      "S This shrinking workforce may signal the advent of less productive workforce and financial strain on the members of the workforce as they need to produce adequate amount of outputs to support the burgeoning elderly population ( Schuiz et al. , 1991 ) .\n",
      "S On top of that , a shrinking and less productive workforce could have an adverse impact on the country 's economic growth .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government should divert more resources such as increased investments in human capital to improve , or at least sustain , the productivity of the workforce and the country 's economic growth .\n",
      "S With sufficient economic growth , it would bring prosperity to the country and in turn benefit the society as a whole .\n",
      "S The additional profits reaped from this investment may in turn regenerate to the public funds to help the needy ones , including the elderly .\n",
      "S Hence , the investments in other areas of the country 's development would not be at expense of the needs of the elderly ; in actual fact , it could create a win-win situation .\n",
      "S In addition , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas may not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S Government is still taking care of the aged from various aspects .\n",
      "S One aspect is the formulating of policies with the elderly in mind .\n",
      "S For instance , the Singapore government has passed the Maintenance of Parents Act to allow elderly parents to file lawsuit against their children for financial support ( Khalik , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This legislation would help to discourage adult children from shirking their responsibility of looking after their aged parents .\n",
      "S In addition , the government has long enforced individual savings through the mandatory CPF , propelling the population to save for their old age ( Wijaya , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This approach taken by the government would enable the individuals to accumulate wealth , and hence depend lesser on families and government financially in their twilight years .\n",
      "S Through these various aspects , it therefore shows that governments have taken a more well-rounded approach in taking care of the needs of the elderly ; and that public spending on the aged is not and should not be used as a single depiction of how governments can express their concerns towards the elderly .\n",
      "S In a nutshell , limiting the public spending on the aged and diverting resources to other areas of the country 's development do not necessarily mean that the government is neglecting the needs of the aged .\n",
      "S One should note that setting limits on the public spending on the aged is to reduce the over-dependency of the aged on the government while diverting resources to other areas of development is to allow the country to prosper and sequentially benefit the whole community , which includes the aged .\n",
      "S It is through this approach , pressing issues such as economic implications of aging population can be resolved and at the same time , more revenue can be generated to help the needy ones that comprise the elderly as well .\n",

      "S This fund is generated through various economic activities , usually in the form of taxation .\n",
      "S The debate often revolves round how the government utilizes this fund , which is contributed by the citizens .\n",
      "S The total amount collected from an economy tends to be more or less fixed in the short term .\n",
      "S Therefore , if one group of people gets more , the others would get lesser .\n",
      "S Thus , by limiting the spending on the aged , it would mean that other sectors of the society would get more than before .\n",
      "S This essay will discuss on the limit that should be imposed to the amount of funds that should be budgeted for spending on the aged that would constitute as a fair distribution of government resources .\n",
      "S This is due to the fact that the aged is not the only dependent group in society .\n",
      "S If there is a tendency to spend more than necessary on the aged ; other sectors of the economy might find that they lack finances to function normally .\n",
      "S Some might say that it is immoral to deprive the aged of the help they need .\n",
      "S They tend to support this argument by considering the contributions made by the aged during their hey-days and the level of their dependency in this season of their lives .\n",
      "S However , this school of thought focuses on only one aspect of the issues of society .\n",
      "S There is no doubt that some of the aged need helps .\n",
      "S However , they are not the only dependent group .\n",
      "S A country is likely to also include the poor , the uneducated , the physically disabled , the intellectually underdeveloped , and many others who require constant monetary aid from the government .\n",
      "S Thus , it can almost be called an ill-informed decision when one claims that the government should take care of the aged without limits .\n",
      "S There is no doubt that we should ensure that the aged could age with dignity .\n",
      "S However , not only for the aged , other citizens who are dependent on the government 's help should also have the right to live with dignity too .\n",
      "S Thus , while the government educates the aged about their rights and campaigns about health maintenance methods , the other sectors of society in need of help should not be left out .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that other citizens of the country who are in need can also receive aid .\n",
      "S A second argument is that financial support for the aged is essential to maintain a certain level of standard of living for the aged .\n",
      "S It may be true that without the help from the government , some senior citizens would struggle just to survive .\n",
      "S However , if the state takes care of the aged unconditionally , it would be a policy impossible to maintain in a long run .\n",
      "S Unrestrained expenditure on the aged can be likened to an endless pit .\n",
      "S Without clear guidelines , the elderly could easily abuse the system .\n",
      "S This is especially true when the cost of visiting subsidized public hospitals falls below that of visiting general practitioners , where the costs are borne solely by the patients .\n",
      "S Without a limitation based on the results of means testing , it would lead to a large number of people applying for grants even when they are not in dire need for such concessions .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the government puts in place many rules and regulations for citizens to gain access to public aid like the Public Assistance Scheme .\n",
      "S This is to make sure that those who eventually get the money are those who genuinely need financial assistance , not simply because they are fall into the right age category .\n",
      "S ( Stolberg and Zeleny , 2009 ) President Obama aimed to modify America 's health care policy to one that 'provides security and stability to those who have insurance and cover those who do not , all without adding to the federal deficit' .\n",
      "S The New York Times ( 2009 ) states that the health care system in the United States of America ( USA ) today is 'full of waste and abuse' .\n",
      "S This is due to the fact that USA is a welfare state and provides pension for the retired .\n",
      "S This financial scheme resulted in USA being the country spending most on health care , leading to a great strain on the government budget ( The New York Times , 2009 , 14 September ) .\n",
      "S In this light , we can be sure that this excessive amount of money is not well-spent .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to prevent misuse of funds that could be better channeled back to the economy , where more government budget would most likely be generated .\n",
      "S There are also others who argue that the aged should be entitled to unlimited funds as it is difficult to ensure that all the basic needs of the aged are met .\n",
      "S They would rather provide more so that all the aged are taken care of , rather than risk any one of them suffering due to insufficient aid .\n",
      "S However , this would likely benefit only a portion of the society and deprive the other sectors of the funds needed .\n",
      "S In society today , there are certain industries , known as the public goods , which require government involvement to exist .\n",
      "S For example , if the government does not invest in training an army of their own , no citizen will pay from their own pocket for it .\n",
      "S Such facilities benefit everyone in the country and it is difficult to exclude anyone from enjoying it .\n",
      "S Thus , everyone tends to wait for their neighbours to provide for them .\n",
      "S The widespread of such mentality would then result in the government having to provide these services .\n",
      "S Therefore , if public spending on the aged is not limited , there will be lesser funds channeled to works such as the building of roads , the provision of street lights , the maintenance of policemen and cleaning of the streets .\n",
      "S With restricted budget in these sectors , we may have to live with a lower quality of life and a less secured nation , which would also lower the living standards amongst the aged .\n",
      "S Thus , it is necessary to specify limits to public spending on the aged , so that sufficient funds can be channeled to provide other facilities for the nation as a whole .\n",
      "S In conclusion , caring for the elderly is only right and necessary .\n",

      "S Indirectly , this will strengthen the family ties and allows the senior citizens to seek companionship of their children or grandchildren .\n",
      "S However , there are still cases , whereby children refuse to support their parents though they are capable of doing .\n",
      "S With the introduction of Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents ( Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [ MCYS ] , 2009 ) , parents who are over 60 of age and incapable of supporting themselves can file petitions against their children to seek financial support from their children .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , the pillars of the future are further instilled with the importance of moral values such as filial piety by having moral civics lesson in schools to infuse the importance of familial commitment .\n",
      "S Lastly , Residual Model policies are in placed to ease the aging process as they act as the last straw of the social safety net when the elderly have inability of self-reliance or no familial support .\n",
      "S For instance , Public Assistance Scheme whereby senior citizens are given cash grants and free treatment at polyclinics and government or restructured hospitals .\n",
      "S Another example will be the Medical Endowment Fund ( Ministry of Health [ MOH ] , 2007 ) , which are known as Medifund and Medifund Silver , whereby elderly are given provision of medical funds due to not having a Medisave or Medishield Account , or who did not accumulate enough in these accounts , or have no immediate family member to pay their hospital bills .\n",
      "S This enables every senior citizen to be able to receive medical attention when needed .\n",
      "S Another argument against these assistance schemes is that these will increase the dependency of the senior citizen on the government as they know that if they will be provided if they have inability to pay for their medical bill .\n",
      "S However , government stresses that these policies do not entitle all citizens to share the same benefits through mean testing , whereby the individuals are accessed according to their financial situation and bill size .\n",
      "S Affordability of a patient is now dictated by the government and patient who is considered not qualified for the fund will end up paying more , this will in turn highlights the importance of self- reliance .\n",
      "S Although there are still flaws in the current policies , shortcoming of one policy can be overcome with other policies and developments .\n",
      "S To a large extent , current policies have help to ease the aging process however it is essentially important that all the policies were put together to have the optimal result as the policies complement each other .\n",
      "S On the whole , Singapore government have not overlooked the underprivileged senior citizens by providing safety net to ensure their basic needs are met .\n",
      "S Therefore , in helping to shape the aging population to age gracefully , Singapore government have constantly emphasised on the importance of self reliance and shunning away from being a welfare state without undermining the familial commitment and work ethnic of the senior citizens .\n",
      "S Aging with grace , are ones with good health and lifestyles , financial stability and coupled with company of family and friends .\n",

      "S According to the United Nations statistics , by 2050 , one of every five people will be 60 years old and above and the total number of people who are 60 years old and above is projected to be around 2 billion .\n",
      "S It is a cause for concern , as with more elderly present in the society , it will affect our economic and social development significantly .\n",
      "S Therefore , in most parts of the world , governments are coming up with policies and sponsoring researches to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Aging process can be eased by increasing birth rates , increased workforce productivity and reduce the physical and psychological aspects of aging .\n",
      "S Currently , governments have helped to ease the aging process in terms of the country 's economic development , social aspects and technological developments .\n",
      "S Firstly , aging population greatly threatens the country 's economic development because with more elderly retiring , the workforce productivity falls sharply .\n",
      "S Therefore , in most countries , governments have increased the retirement age in order to encourage the elderly to continue working to increase productivity .\n",
      "S In Finland , which had the most rapidly aging population in Europe has successfully raised the retirement age from 60.1 to 60.7 in 2004 , together with a pension reform introduced in 2005 to ease pressure on the state pension system .\n",
      "S ( Kunz , 2007 ) Another method to increase the workforce productivity is to invite foreign talents and immigrants to stay and work , in order to counter the low birth rate of the country .\n",
      "S For instance , one of the main factors for Spain rising birth rates was due to a huge influx of immigrants from Latin America and North Africa .\n",
      "S ( Spain-Demographic Trends ) However , these policies may not be effective because due to the influx of immigrants , locals view foreign workers as a threat and may cause social unrest .\n",
      "S For instance , in Australia , there is a rise of hate crimes against the immigrants .\n",
      "S Even so , employers should hire their employees based on their capability and not nationality in order to avoid such crimes and through this policy , it will increase the country 's competiveness , which will increase the country 's workforce productivity and boost the economy .\n",
      "S Therefore , by increasing the retirement and recruiting immigrants , we have partly eased the economic aspect of aging process .\n",
      "S Secondly , by growing old , it is inevitable to gain low self-esteem due to people stereotyping the old as slow and weak .\n",
      "S Also , their children may not be able to take care of their emotional welfare because of their busy career hence they maybe prone to depression .\n",
      "S Hence , governments are now educating the public to volunteer their services to organizations and nursing homes in order to broaden the elderly social circle .\n",
      "S In addition , the government is trying to encourage companies to hire older workers by providing incentives to it .\n",
      "S By doing so , the elderly will feel more socially accepted and less cases of elderly dying alone in their house .\n",
      "S However , others may disagree that these actions are not effective because educating the young does take a long time especially when the aging problems are pressing at the moment .\n",
      "S It is true that the fruits of education take years to harvest , however according to statistics given , the national volunteerism rate in Singapore has risen from 15.2 to 15.5 in 2006 , this does shows that more people are concerned about the elderly .\n",
      "S It was an improvement , albeit a small one .\n",
      "S However , through education not only the youths will be more accepting of the elderly but also , in the future they will most likely not to practise ageism in workplace and this thinking will be ingrained in the society thus generating positive outcomes .\n",
      "S Therefore , current policies and campaigns are effective in easing the social aspect of aging process .\n",
      "S Moreover , with current technology advancement , we can tackle the physical barriers of aging problems such as low birth rate , increased productivity and reduced physical effects of aging , which may partly attribute to elderly low self-esteem .\n",
      "S With current technology , infertile couples can have a baby through In-Vitro Fertilization ( IVF ) .\n",
      "S In addition , in Japan , researchers and scientists have invented robots to replace older workers in order to increase the workforce .\n",
      "S With potent medicine , the aged are able to live longer and healthier .\n",
      "S Others may argue that the main cause of aging problem is actually longer life span itself .\n",
      "S However , it does prove that current technological advancement is indeed effective in prolonging the population 's life span .\n",
      "S With longer life span , people can continue to contribute to society by imparting their knowledge and skills to the next generation .\n",
      "S By doing so , the aged will be more appreciated by the public and also it does help to improve the country 's economy with an increased workforce .\n",
      "S Therefore , having longer life span does help to ease aging process .\n",
      "S Hence , technological advancement does help to ease the economic , social and physical aspects of aging process .\n",
      "S In conclusion , it seems like governments from all over the world are prepared to counter the rising aging population problems .\n",
      "S Although certain measures are not effective immediately , we should continue to support it as it is worth the wait .\n",

      "S By limiting public spending on aged and diverting money to other areas of development , government can increase economic growth .\n",

      "S Government will have less money to divert to other development areas .\n",
      "S Money can be diverted into other areas which require more budgets such as business .\n",
      "S In fact , there was a significant shrinking in economic which is 3.8 percent in 2008 compared to 4.7 percent in 2007 ( Mussa,2008 ) .By diverting more money into business area , government gives incentives to companies in order to encourages them to explore and invest .\n",

      "S Thus , economic growth will be increased by limiting public spending on aged and diverting money into business area .\n",

      "S The labour age composition has thus shift towards the older workers , where implications towards the competitiveness of Singapore 's economy will occur , especially if older workers do not make significant contribution to the productivity growth in the economy ( Thangavelu , Yong , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S Hence more support and care for the aged should be provided which in turn will pose a strain to the younger generation .\n",
      "S As of 2008 , '8.4 economically active persons are supporting one elderly ' ( Singstats , 2008 ) and 'by 2030 , only 3.5 persons will be supporting one elderly ' ( CPF , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S This has reflected the importance for each individual to have the ability to support themselves through their golden years .\n",
      "S In order to do so , Singapore has introduced policies that worked to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Facing high cost of living , Singapore has moved up from the 13th position in 2008 to the 10th in 2009 , in the worldwide cost of living ranking ( Mercer , 2009 ) , especially for the medical cost , where each household spend an increasing amount of expenditure in health care , with 3.3 % in 1998 to 5.1 % in 2003 ( Singstats , 2007 ) , and is expected to further increase in the future years , with more aged citizens in Singapore .\n",
      "S Hence , Singapore has introduced policies to ease healthcare financing , such as Medisave , Medishield , Medifund , and Eldershield ( MOH , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Singaporeans have recognized the need to prepare for aging in terms of escalating medical costs , thus net withdrawal of Medisave scheme , including Eldershield , has dropped to 213.6 million in 2009 , and Medishield scheme of 62.5 million ( CPF , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S A drop in withdrawal of healthcare schemes has thus reflected that more Singaporeans have felt the need for such policies .\n",
      "S Singapore has not only faced with aging population resulted from low fertility rates , but also longer life expectancy for individuals .\n",
      "S With rising life expectancy , given only 2.5 % of annual interest in the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , and with most funds in the CPF used to fund housing or tertiary education , the CPF figure left is no longer sufficient to last through retirement ( OCBC , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S \" The best way for people to adjust to longer life spans is to continue working for as long as they can \" ( PM Lee , 2009 ) , as working provides a source of income , more savings can thus be build up .\n",
      "S Increasing the retirement age is insufficient to encourage individuals to work longer , hence the Re-employment policy will be enact in 2012 .\n",
      "S In order to ensure that older workers are not at disadvantage , Singapore established schemes such as smaller CPF contributions to the aged ( CPF , 2009 ) , as well as the Advantage !\n",
      "S Scheme introduced in 2005 ( MCYS , 2009 ) to lighten the cost of hiring the aged as well as to move away from the seniority-wage system and provide assistance in funding to re-employ mature workers .\n",
      "S And as of 2005 , 1,142 companies have benefited from this scheme .\n",
      "S In addition , retraining programmes were also introduced ; an example would be 'Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience ( SPUR ) ' ( MCYS , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Critics of the approach on lowered CPF contribution rates for older workers have argued that it is unnecessary , as 63 % of the respondents felt that \" seniors are not weak and ill \" , 87 % felt that \" senior citizens can play an active role in society \" ( C3A , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S However , based on the last two economic recessions , older workers faced greater risk in losing their jobs , with 2.9 % of unemployment for 50 years and above , compared to 5.2 % for 30 years and below , in 2008 ( MOM , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore to make the aged more employable , there is a need to move away from seniority-wage system and reduce the CPF rates .\n",
      "S In conclusion , people are living longer resulting from better medical facilities , with the policies introduced to help ease the aging process , Singaporeans will be able to keep themselves occupied before formal retirement , and to be able to build up their retirement nest and retire in comfort .\n",

      "S For instance , the researchers have invented medications such as tacrine and donepezil which are used by patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer 's disease ( as cited in health-cares.net , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Researchers not only focus on inventing new medications , they also hope to protect people against mental decline through aerobic exercises and getting a dose of the sun - vitamin D ( as cited in health-cares.net , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Singapore being one of the fastest aging populations in the world , with the estimation of 23 % of the population to be over 65-year-olds by the year 2030 , there is a need for more hospitals to be built to meet the needs of the aging population ( as cited in Singapore faces 'silver tsunami ' , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , Jurong General Hospital which will be up in five years and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital which will be up next year will be linked to a community hospital next door .\n",
      "S This is to ensure that older people will have the right health care treatment at the right place and in return helps them to cut costs ( as cited in The Straits Times , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S It is understandable that older people often require more medical care , but they need not remain in hospital for this care .\n",
      "S Thus , it would be much cheaper for them to get such care from a community hospital - hence the idea of \" stepping down \" the care is needed .\n",
      "S Public transportation systems must continue to expand in order to deal with an aging population .\n",
      "S In June 2006 , Singapore Bus Services ( SBS ) transit launches Singapore 's First Ever Wheelchair accessible buses - Service 21 ( as cited in SBS transit , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S In conjunction , another public transport operator Singapore Mass Rapid Transit ( SMRT ) came up with its first wheelchair-friendly buses on June 2009 ( as cited in Wheelchair-friendly bus , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S With these buses , the elderly and wheelchair bounded commuters could travel conveniently to hospitals and polyclinics for their medical appointments .\n",
      "S Even with government funding , not every Singaporean is able to luxuriate in the use of better healthcare and public facilities .\n",
      "S Even with government subsidies and paying through their CPF they might still find it hectic to handle hefty medical bills .\n",
      "S Hence , even a small family with a monthly income of $ 10,000 might also find it difficult to cope with a big hospital bill , if they have to support one or two elderly people with chronic illness ( as cited in The Straits Times , 2004 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , policy such as senior citizens ' bonus the where lower-income elderly aged 55 and above with an annual income of $ 100,000 or less will receive $ 200 to $ 1000 over a period of 4 years ( as cited in GST Offset Package , 2009 ) to lighten the burden of lower income families .\n",

      "S In conclusion , amelioration and subsidizing of healthcare and public facilities has eased the aging population .\n",

      "S When Singapore 's Ministry of Finance unveiled the government budget for 2009 , it is stated that an estimated total of S $ 66 million or 0.15 % of the total government expenditure will be spent on establishing various programs and upgrading facilities for the elderly ( Singapore Budget 2009 , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S As the problem of aging population intensifies throughout the years , there will always be a debate on how much of the public spending should be allocated to the aged .\n",
      "S While it is important to provide funds for implementing policies to support the elderly , it is plausible for the government to work on areas which can aid both the country 's development as well as provide support towards the aged .\n",
      "S Firstly , it is vital to develop the country 's economy .\n",
      "S A sustained economic growth improves the level of business activities , ensures low unemployment rate and increases government tax revenue .\n",
      "S More funds is thus available to finance additional projects for the needy including the aged .\n",
      "S Also , more people will become self-sufficient and therefore able to support themselves , even without government aid .\n",
      "S Hence , more funds can be directed to other economic development areas ( Friedland and Summer , March 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Contrarily , with slower growth , more people will be unemployed and more money would have to be spent on unemployment benefits .\n",
      "S This will inevitably constrict the public spending on the aged due to a smaller pool of resources .\n",
      "S Secondly , the funding spent on the education sector can not be compromised .\n",
      "S Cheney ( 2007 ) wrote that children are the pillars of the nation .\n",
      "S This means that the country 's progression will depend on the next generation .\n",
      "S If the young are not well educated , there may be social implications such as increasing crime rates and unemployment .\n",
      "S In a research done by Shirley ( 2007 ) , crime rate and education have an inverse relationship .\n",
      "S This is due to the increased opportunity costs involved with a higher education level .\n",
      "S Adversely , there is a positive relationship between higher education and employment opportunities ( Harvey , 2000 ) .\n",
      "S This is because employers tend to link working abilities with academic qualifications .\n",
      "S Hence , reduction in education expenditure will put the country 's progress at risk .\n",
      "S Critics may argue that even if the country is performing well economically , she may not be progressing socially if she fails to address the people 's needs , especially the elderly 's .\n",
      "S This is because the elderly have once contributed to the country 's economy and their well-being should not be overlooked when they aged and unable to work .\n",
      "S Thus , it is justifiable that the society should give in return and support the old members of the workforce , on the account of their past contributions to the nation .\n",
      "S Furthermore , aging is a natural process and everyone will grow old one day .\n",
      "S When the time comes , it is man 's instinct to hope that more efforts will be invested to help him .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is pertinent that the government does not overlook their needs .\n",
      "S However , it is essential to regulate the amount spent on assisting the aged .\n",
      "S Some fear that with government aid , some may in turn become over-reliant and fail to be self-sufficient .\n",
      "S Therefore , it would be better for the government to offer the basic infrastructure and introduce policies to help the aged gain independence while receiving necessary help .\n",
      "S For example , one feasible policy is to encourage companies to provide extra training for the older workers to stay in touch with the advancing technology , thus increasing their working lifespan disregarding health factors .\n",
      "S Not only will the elderly become more financially able , they will also attain a sense of belonging in the society and purpose in their lives .\n",
      "S Concurrently , the government can invest in other sectors , such as the research and development sector , which will indirectly aid the aged .\n",
      "S For instance , public facilities , such as buses , are being upgraded and improved to facilitate easier movement for the elderly and handicapped .\n",
      "S Also , there are ongoing medical research on senile dementia and Parkinson 's disease .\n",
      "S All these will improve the lives of the elderly significantly .\n",
      "S In conclusion , public spending for the aged is a necessity but should be regulated .\n",
      "S In order to strike a balance and better maintain the state of the economy , the government has to prioritize the country 's needs and analyze the current problems the country is facing .\n",
      "S Resources are always limited , thus the government has to allocate them cautiously for the continuous development of the nation .\n"

      "S Since the tax is the main resource of governments ' revenue , and the tax base could hardly be increased in short run , overspending limited budget on retirement welfare for the time being means less investing in improving infrastructure , and developing advanced technology , which could greatly accelerate economic development in the long run .\n",
      "S In that case , governments would have less financial flexibility due to the relatively smaller scale of economy with less tax revenue generated by limited scale of workforce .\n",
      "S In real life , the shrinking workforce caused by aging population has contributed to a significant decline in real GDP in some developed countries such as French and Germany .\n",
      "S This means that the capacity that these governments have to support aging population in the long run would eventually be weakened due to a lower budget .\n",
      "S Secondly , the answer to the problem with regard to aging population should be the cooperation between the elders themselves and the government , not simply by given priority in terms of unlimited government spending .\n",
      "S For example , government could help in training elders and engaging them with more jobs .\n",

      "S In the CIA factbook ( 2009 ) , the life expectancy for Singapore is 81.98 years which is ranked fourth in the world .\n",
      "S This means that the aged would live longer and drain their families and their own savings as the hospital fees are costly and thus more subsidies are required ( Friedland & Summer , 2005 , p.g.17 ) .\n",
      "S Moreover , money is also needed to provide the prevention and screenings programmes for the elderly and to educate them about the benefits of having a healthy lifestyle and ways to stay healthy .\n",
      "S These screenings can also help to identify potential health problems that they might have and get them to seek treatment before it worsens and disrupt their daily activities .\n",
      "S Hence , spending on elderly healthcare is necessary as it helps to educate the elderly on the importance of healthy lifestyle while reducing the burden on the elderly and their family for the costly healthcare services .\n",
      "S Moreover , there is a high chance that the elderly may use up their retirement savings on healthcare and daily necessities despite the implementation of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) to lessen their burden .\n",
      "S Dr Ng ( 2007 ) stated that CPF members would also use up their CPF account in time due to the higher standard of living in the future .\n",
      "S In addition , based on Statistic Singapore ( 2008 ) , the old age support ratio has decreased from 11.8 in 1990 to 8.4 in 2008 .\n",
      "S This shows that there are fewer young working adults to support the elderly .\n",
      "S It also signifies that the elderly has to either prolong retirement or increase their saving in order to support themselves after retirement .\n",
      "S Therefore , retraining is needed for the elderly as through these retraining , they can upgrade their skills and adapt to the demanding working environment to save up for the future and contribute to the economy .\n",
      "S Hence , spending on pension and retraining for the elders is essential and should not be limited as it aids them in being financially independent after retirement .\n",
      "S On the other hand , money is also needed in the other areas of development like education .\n",
      "S Education plays an important part in the country development and growth as it helps in nurturing the young who are the country 's future .\n",
      "S Thus , the expenditure on education is also important instead of focusing on the aging population .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , the Ministry of Finance ( 2009 ) had stated that they are planning to provide quality education by setting aside $ 4.4 billion for basic education for the young and $ 3.5 billion for the higher education like the polytechnics and universities .\n",
      "S This is in hope of improving education sector and nurture the young better for the future of Singapore .\n",
      "S Moreover , the Ministry of Education ( 2009 ) had also stated that the budget for education had increased by 5.5 % .\n",
      "S Hence , this shows that despite the increase in the spending for the aged , it does not mean that the other areas of development will be neglected as each development plays an important part in the growth of the country .\n",
      "S In conclusion , spending on the aged should not be limited due the costly healthcare expenses and limited retirement saving for the future .\n",
      "S These expenditures can help to improve the lifestyle of elderly and being healthy the elderly will be able to prolong their retirement which in turn helps in improving the economic .\n",

      "S Denmark 's welfare expenditure contributes to 37.9 % of the nation 's GDP and the GDP per capita ( PPPUS $ ) is $ 37,265 whereas Japan 's welfare expenditure contributes to 16.9 % of the nation 's GDP and its GDP per capita ( PPPUS $ ) is $ 38,559 ( Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [ OECD ] 2001 ) .\n",
      "S From this statistic , we can draw that it is also possible for Singapore to learn from these success stories and increase welfare expenditure while achieving economic growth at the same time .\n",
      "S Singapore is different from the welfare states in Europe such as Germany and Denmark .\n",
      "S Singapore is practicing the open market policy thus being more susceptible to external factors .\n",
      "S A recent example would be when the United States 's economy fell during the credit crisis , Singapore was badly impacted by the recession .\n",
      "S One of the major growth engines in the Singapore 's economy is the manufacturing sector .\n",
      "S Unlike China who has abundance in labour , Singapore on the other hand has little natural resources and is unable to compete with China on a large scale .\n",
      "S ( Singapore , a small country with limited resources can outperform others by ) distinguishing our manufacturing goods by investing more money to invent cutting edge technology , to increase efficiency , to make our products unique and competitive in the market .\n",
      "S In order to finance the current schemes in Singapore , the economy has to be growing first so that it could support its schemes .\n",
      "S Currently Government Health Expenditure has been limited at 0.9 % from 2005 to 2007 ( Ministry of Health [ MOH ] , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Since Government Health Expenditure is capped at a percentage of GDP regardless of boom or bust in the economy , therefore the amount of money diverted to Health Expenditure in a bullish economy is higher than when it is during a bearish economy .\n",
      "S As the saying goes \" Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .\n",
      "S Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime \" This is especially true for the senior citizens whose skills are outdated in the current society but has an able body to earn an income for themselves .\n",
      "S Instead of diverting resources to finance the welfare schemes , the government should instead divert resources into retraining and integrating the senior citizens back into the work force .\n",
      "S Senior citizens possess a large amount of experience which are valuable to the younger generation now , thus they are more of an asset than a liability .\n",
      "S \" For every working adult in Singapore , He/She has to support 8.4 elderly Residents aged 65 years and above ( Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports [ MCYS ] 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore to ease the burden on the younger generation who has to support the post baby boomers as they approach their retirement years , it would be a win-win situation if we integrate senior citizens back into the work force .\n",
      "S As countries differ both ideologically and geographically , there is no one solution that solves the current situation of an aging population .\n",
      "S Thus with different government 's goals , the solution will adjusted to suit the country .\n",
      "S But in Singapore 's context , Singapore does not have any natural resources and ( we ) dependent on innovation and creativity to gain an advantage over its competitors .\n",
      "S In order to finance these welfare programs , we need to divert resources to other areas in order to have continuous growth in Singapore .\n",
      "S However government intervention alone is insufficient to finance the welfare schemes alone .\n",
      "S Thus it has included private charity organization such as National Council of Social Service ( NCSS ) to attend to the needs of the aged and the needy together with the help of the government .\n",

      "S Therefore to ensure effective public spending , funds should be channelled into several other economical and social aspects of the country 's development by limiting spending on the aged .\n",
      "S To begin with , the current global economic climate is not helping matters much .\n",
      "S Therefore , firstly , money should be diverted into the economic sector , namely stimulation of the domestic economy .\n",
      "S For example , the $ 20.5 billion resilience package announced by the government of Singapore is intended to save jobs by helping valuable companies survive the recession , prepare for the near future , increase the competitiveness of the country and prevent a further slump in the economy ( The Online Citizen , 2009 ) .\n",

      "S In the face of such a situation , spending on the aged is of least priority .\n",
      "S The second way in which money can be diverted into the economy is through spending on infrastructure .\n",

      "S Such investments will provide stability to the country in the long-run as it increases the confidence of potential investors .\n",

      "S However on the other hand , critics argue that the economic growth alone does not dictate a country 's development .\n",
      "S They claim that spending on the aged is as important .\n",
      "S According to Peter G. Peterson ( 2001 ) , \" demographic changes such as the increasing population of the aged will have a serious consequence on healthcare issues in developed countries \" and he also goes on to advocate ways to spend on healthcare .\n",
      "S But if this spending can be alternatively channelled into other sectors of the country 's development , such as infrastructure and domestic economy as mentioned above , the country will achieve long-run success and stability .\n",
      "S Hence the demographics of a country alone , does not determine its destiny .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending should be spent on a country 's economical development .\n",
      "S Another way in which money can be well spent on the country 's development would be to spend on societal needs such as education and general healthcare .\n",
      "S As the saying goes , \" knowledge is power \" and rightly so .\n",
      "S Singapore was able to pull itself out of the rut from a third world country to a first world country in one generation due to its focus on well utilised human resource .\n",
      "S And the main contributor was education .\n",
      "S Public spending on education accounts for 19.3 % of the total budget and is second in terms of priority in spending succeeding defence ( Singapore Budget , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S A well educated society will always be at an advantage and this will act as a catalyst for further growth in several other sectors in Singapore 's economy .\n",
      "S Hence a knowledge based economy will propel the nation into societal development .\n",
      "S The flipside to this issue is that , sectors such as healthcare play an important role in a country 's societal development too .\n",
      "S Public spending on aged healthcare accounts for the bulk of the spending which is precisely why it should be limited .\n",
      "S Children of the aged should be given more responsibility for shouldering the financial needs of their parents rather than the government .\n",
      "S This allows money to be spent on more pertinent sectors such as education which has been a traditional source of growth for Singapore .\n",
      "S Hence , public spending on the economy and aspects of society outweigh spending on the aged as money can be better utilized elsewhere for a country 's development .\n",

      "S Fast aging in population is an issue that most countries including Singapore can not avoid .\n",
      "S Several problems which relate to the issue include Health , Financial and Welfare of the elderly has come under the concern of the government .\n",
      "S Solutions such as having different subsidy frameworks for community hospitals to help patients to cope with the expensive bills ( Ministry of Health [ MOH ] , 2009 ) and monthly Transport allowance for elderly who visit day-care centres ( Lin , 2008 ) were implemented to ease the tension that fast aging has brought to the low income elderly .\n",
      "S A decrease in the labour force due to retired workers and providing elderly with a place to stay are the issues that the Singapore government is working on now .\n",
      "S Fast ageing in Singapore has certainly affected its labour market as the level of retirement rate increase .\n",
      "S A research report done by the Ministry of Manpower Singapore in year 1999 showed that in year 2020 the old age will be increased to 32 % compared to 16 % in 1998 ( Ministry of Manpower [ MOM ] , 1999 ) .\n",
      "S This implies that there will be a labour shortage of experienced workers who are able to contribute to the labour force after they have retired .\n",
      "S For example , new workers who are hired to replace the vacancy of the retired workers often lack experience and knowledge .\n",
      "S As a result , the workers might not be able to complete the task due to their minimum knowledge and skills therefore , the functioning of the company will be affected ( MOM , 1999 ) .\n",
      "S One of the solutions to minimize the impact of labour shortage could be to re-employ the retired workers and allow them to guide the new workers on the job as well as sharing their working experience that will benefit the new workers .\n",
      "S Providing shelters to the single or low-income elderly is one of the priorities in the housing estate development program .\n",
      "S Single or low-income elderly could choose to rent a flat from the Housing Development Board ( HDB ) or downgrade their current flat to a smaller one as this will allow the elderly to have extra cash for them to spend after their retirement .\n",
      "S HDB will also be building more compact and affordable 30-year lease studio apartment to cater to the demand for the elderly who aged 55 and above ( Tan , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Besides that , more HDB rental flats will also be upgraded with more Elderly-Friendly Facilities .\n",
      "S Facilities such as , having lifts on every floor , installing features like support handbars in the toilets and along common corridors to assist in the mobility of the elderly and installing an alert alarm system in the house when the elderly residents need to seek for any emergency help ( Housing & Development Board [ HDB ] , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S No matter how many hardware facilities were installed to improve the staying environment of the elderly , they still feel empty and lonely especially if one has no family .\n",
      "S According to a health topic published by Changi General Hospital , elderly tends to be at a much higher risk of depression and ending one 's life than the young as they are facing several changes in their life such as illnesses , losses of family member , life partners and friends as well as financial issues which include no income after retirement ( Changi General Hospital [ CG ] , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , several voluntary programs have been implemented to serve as a helping hand to the elderly .\n",
      "S Program such as The Befriender Service , provided by Lions Befrienders is working closely with Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks ( CLN ) in the aim of easing the loneliness , isolation and boredom of the single elderly and the homebound and also providing services such as advisory and assistance to the elderly ( Central Singapore ComCare Local Networks , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S Coping with fast ageing in Singaporean is a slow and tough process which requires both the government and its citizens to work closely together .\n",
      "S Either encouraging retired workers to return to the work force or providing a decent shelter for the low income elderly will defiantly send a positive message to the elderly that they are not being abandoned and they are still recognised by the society .\n",
      "S Programs such as visiting the elderly or providing assistance to the elderly will also increase their confidence and accept the society again .\n",
      "S In the near future , the tax burden on each individual working adult would increase due to the issue of aging population .\n",
      "S It may not seem like a major issue in Singapore from the public 's eyes , but not so in the near future .\n",
      "S The old age dependency ratio will increase from one elder adult relying on 10 working adults in 2000 to 3 working adults in 2030 .\n",
      "S ( Fu & Hughes , 2009 , p.g.124 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , some might argue , why not reduce the spending on elderly and invest in other areas of the country 's development which are profitable .\n",
      "S The repercussions and generator of economic growth indicates to us why the public spending on the aged should not be limited .\n",
      "S Singapore has a population of 4.8 million and 8.7 % percent of them are aged .\n",
      "S The aged are part of the society ; we should also take into consideration their needs ( Singstat , 2008 , p.g.1 ) .\n",
      "S With limitations , it will create more social problems and repercussions that result in higher costs that far outweigh the amount of money that was transferred to other developments .\n",
      "S Due to the decrease in healthcare aid for elderly , lack of community hospitals and housing homes , social problems would be generated .\n",
      "S The outcome would be homeless elderly turning into beggars and outbreak of diseases as healthcare becomes unaffordable for them to maintain and hygiene becomes an issue .\n",
      "S Investors and tourists would be deterred from entering Singapore as this does not reflect the branding of Singapore to be clean , green and having a stable economy .\n",
      "S The government might end up paying more for the aftermath just for the sake of transition of budgets in other developments .\n",
      "S The spending on the aged should be treated as a social and economic development which prepares healthcare facilities for the society as a whole and boosts healthcare spending by the tourists .\n",
      "S By investing in healthcare facilities and medical insurances for the elderly , this will result in a high profile ; risk free , user friendly , low cost and safe healthcare solution that does not just benefit the elderly but the society as a whole ( Munshi , 2007 , p.g.1 ) .\n",
      "S In times of recession , the spending on the aged would have a direct relation to employment as there will be more labour required to take care of the elderly .\n",
      "S This employment can help to spur economic growth and help in recession .\n",
      "S Singapore is seen as a medical hub due to its excellent geographical location and provision of top notch healthcare services .\n",
      "S Thus , the spending in a way brings in medical tourism revenues for healthcare services and tourism for the medical travellers ( Yin , 2009 , p.g.1 ) .\n",
      "S Treatments that take up to years may result in migration of the family of the sick ; this eventually snowballs to a few million dollars of revenue for the tourism industry .\n",
      "S In contrast , public spending on the aged should be limited and routed for the less well-off section of the society .\n",
      "S With consumer price index ( CPI ) for low income groups rising to 7.5 % in June 2008 and developments in globalization , it creates vast income inequalities in Singapore ( Singstat , 2008 , p.g.1 ) .\n",
      "S The Department of Statistics ( 2008 ) commented that 14.8 % of households here earned $ 2,000 or less a month in 2008 , which explains the need for more money to be pumped into the social safety net .\n",
      "S However , there are initiatives such as Comcare Fund , which assists the less privileged group in Singapore .\n",
      "S The Comcare Fund 's budget is $ 63.7 million in 2008 and this amount is estimated to be $ 168 million in this financial year ( MCYS , 2008 , pg.1 ) .\n",
      "S MCYS would also adjust the budget according to situations such as setting aside $ 1million to help the needy cope with inflation ( Majid , 2008 , p.g1 ) Hence , the Government has provided an effective social safety net that provides assistance yet at the same time promotes self-reliance to the needy .\n",
      "S It also portrays an image that the Government is concerned with other developments in Singapore other than the aged .\n",
      "S To sum up , the spending on the aged should not be limited as it spurs economic growth and prepares the healthcare industry to combat this pressing issue .\n"

      "S Hence , several polices have been implemented by the government to help ease the aging process .\n",

      "S Upgrading of housing by the HDB , particularly the elderly households , has helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Facilities within the blocks were enhanced significantly to aid in the day-to-day movement of the elderly ( Housing and Development Board , 2008 ) .\n",

      "S In order to allow the elderly to receive immediate help in times of emergency , alert alarm systems are fitted in every flat .\n",
      "S These changes have made the lives of the elderly more convenient leading to a greater sense of security instilled in them .\n",

      "S It creates a cohesive community where the elderly can integrate themselves into the society through participating in various social activities .\n",
      "S Consequently , some of the social and emotional problems that the elderly faced have been resolved .\n",
      "S In addition , encouraging later retirement has proved to ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S Working reduces the elderly reliance on their children as well as the society in terms of economic and social needs ( Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S As work keeps them occupied , they do not feel the need for their children 's companionship .\n",
      "S On top of that , working provides the elderly a source of income enabling them to remain financially independent , hence reducing the financial dependency on the children .\n",
      "S The Government has been cooperating with employers and unions as part of the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers to enact re-employment legislation by 1 January 2012 so that employees can continue to work beyond the statutory retirement age of 62 , up to 65 ( Adding Life to Years !\n",
      "S Happy , Healthy , Active Seniors , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Even before this re-employment legislation has taken effect , more than 700 unionized companies have committed to re-employ around 5,000 workers above the age of 62 .\n",
      "S In fact , working not only allows the elderly to spend their time meaningfully , it can also help to increase their self-esteem and find their own identity in the society ( Adding Life to Years !\n",
      "S Happy , Healthy , Active Seniors , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This helps them realize that they still stand a foothold in the society as they can still contribute to the nation and economic growth , therefore helping them to lead an enriching and fulfilling life .\n",
      "S However , critics have argued that the elderly might not possess the essential skills that are relevant and required in the workforce today ( Seah , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S This is because the society is constantly changing , hence the skills possessed by the older generation becomes obsolete and no longer applicable today .\n",

      "S However , this is not a plausible reason to deter the companies from hiring the elderly as the government has improvised a scheme known as the ADVANTAGE fund to encourage more companies to shift towards automation that facilitate the older populace and to re-employ the elderly by giving out incentives and subsides for retraining programmes of the elderly ( Lim , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S For example , Sheng Siong Supermarket , who hires senior workers , was able to buy machinery that helps to expedite the production process from one month to ten to fifteen days and increase their productivity by using the government subsides ( Chia , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , social policies , such as the ADVANTAGE scheme , are pertinent to facilitate the elderly in working in a less physically-demanding environment and stay productive .\n",
      "S It is mandatory for everyone in Singapore to have a Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) account .\n",
      "S This initiative by the government helps to ensure that all elderly will have a means of income that will provide them through their golden years .\n",
      "S Recent adjustments made to the CPF on 3 September 2009 have played a significant role in reducing the working-age population 's tax burden and also in increasing the elderly 's CPF .\n",
      "S For instance , the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the Special , Medisave and Retirement Accounts ( SMRA ) will be maintained at 4 % floor rate instead of the current 3.40 % for the next two years ( Central Provident Fund Board [ CPF ] , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This eases the economic aspect of an aging population as the elderly can benefit from a higher interest rate and therefore alleviate the deterioration of the aging process .\n",
      "S With an increasingly aging population , many innovative companies have invented several elderly-related products such as hearing aids and automatic wheelchairs to support their large demand for health-care products .\n",
      "S The government has also developed property such as studio apartments with barrier-free accessibilities for the elderly .\n",
      "S All these helped to lessen the elderly 's problems of hearing , seeing or moving properly .\n",
      "S For example , two students from Temasek Polytechnic have developed a wheelchair that automatically engages the safety gear whenever it slides backwards .\n",
      "S This helps to ease the inconvenience for those who are incapable of engaging the conventional brakes or holding on to the wheels manually ( Temasek Polytechnic [ TP ] , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Such innovations ease the problem that the physically restricted are encountering in the process of aging .\n",
      "S In conclusion , it is true that the current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process due to the proper and effective planning adopted by the Singapore government .\n",
      "S Issues such as the reluctance of companies to hire older workers are ameliorated due to the ADVANTAGE scheme whereby subsides encourage them to re-employ the aged .\n",
      "S The changes made to the interest rate of the CPF for savings in the SMRA will provide a social safety net for the elderly , while the increase in elderly- related products and studio apartments further eases the physically restricted aspects of an elderly .\n",
      "S However , these policies and development can help to ease the aging process only if people abandon their social stigma on the elderly populace .\n",

      "S Next , the elderly should change their mindset towards being to old to work , when in actual fact working slows down their brains from aging .\n",

      "S Another social policy that governments seem to turn towards to is the encouragement of the inflow of immigrants into our society .\n",

      "S Singapore , for instance , welcome talented immigrants to 1 \" help us reach our goals \" .\n",

      "S This might mean that Singaporeans will have to compete for jobs with the foreigners , and might stand chances of losing their jobs to them .\n",

      "S For example , in Europe , 2it is estimated that a quarter of her inhabitants will be non-European in origin , character and beliefs , if she continues to depend on importing immigrants to ease her ageing problems .\n",
      "S This reasoning might be flaw as it is inevitable that the locals have to upgrade their skills to ensure high employability in the fast and highly competitive society .\n",
      "S Also , in this increasingly globalised society , it is even more imperative that one keeps one updated , so as not to be outdated , or they will risk losing their jobs to someone more capable , either a local or a foreigner .\n",
      "S In conclusion , I agree to a great extent that social policies such as the implementation of the baby bonuses and the introduction of immigrants into our society will help to ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S However , the government might wish to monitor the situation closely so as not to welcome too many immigrants such that the nation 's culture and identity will be at risk .\n",
      "S Also , they must ensure that the country 's employment rate is healthy before encouraging more foreign talents to the workforce .\n",

      "S Another $ 3.2 million will be set aside to pilot the Wellness Programme to promote active and healthy ageing in the community .\n",
      "S 12 constituencies will set up the Wellness Programme in this pilot phase ( http : //www.singaporebudget.gov.sg ) .Given the countless funds being channeled to them and given that most of the aged nowadays are capable of supporting themselves , the government expenditure on the elderly exceeds what they need .\n",
      "S Whereas the other sectors of the country 's development such as education and healthcare , are still underdeveloped .\n",
      "S Therefore , the public spending on the aged should be limited and more funds should be invested in these areas in order to secure the future of the county and maintain its competitiveness in this fast-paced world .\n",
      "S People would argue that more money should be spent by the government to the elderly , given that the elderly are the more disadvantaged group of the society .\n",
      "S Moreover , the government spending is only beneficial towards the active and healthy elderly , with lesser concern towards those who are unwell and not permitted to work .\n",
      "S And as old age is often associated with deteriorating health , the elderly will have trouble coping with the high medical costs .\n",
      "S Based on a text entitles \" Doomsday Predictions about Population are Exaggerated \" , writers Robert B Friedland and Laura Summer stated that large and long-term healthcare expenses will become a burden to the elderly , especially those who have not been able to save when they were young ( Friedland and Summer,2005 ) .\n",
      "S This would give even a larger burden to the working adults and taxes will definitely increase .\n",
      "S However , as we all know , the elderly only constitutes a smaller part of the society , and the younger ones in the social group must be taken care of the same way or more so than the elderly since they are the determinants of the country 's future .\n",
      "S More money should not be invested on the healthcare of the elderly who are unwell and not fit for work since they do not have any other means to spend on with that much money given by the government , except for their medical fees .\n",
      "S Instead investing more money in education will increase the likeability of the younger people to secure better jobs , and enabling them to provide their elderly parents financial support , no matter in what condition their parents are in .\n",
      "S Based on the statistics obtained from a government statistical website , The level of education attainment among resident non-students aged 25-39 , despite increasing rapidly in the past few years , is still low at 70 percent in 2008 ( www.singstat.gov.sg ) .This means that the government must set aside more money in instilling awareness of the importance of education towards the young .\n",
      "S This can be done by organizing campaigns , and through media such as advertisements and short documentaries .\n",
      "S The Global Campaign for Education for example , has campaigned in many countries in order to instill awareness towards the importance of education .\n",
      "S Therefore , by succeeding in education and secured better jobs , the working adults will ease the burden of the government from having to invest a lot of money to the welfare of the elderly .\n",
      "S Healthcare for the elderly is important in order to enable them to lead better lives .\n",
      "S However , the well-being of the citizens in general is much more important .\n",
      "S As discussed earlier , the younger citizens are the jewels of the country that determines its future .\n",
      "S The country needs healthy and abled citizens to ensure the country 's progress .\n",
      "S Therefore , more of the government 's investments should go to the younger citizens .\n",
      "S Moreover , these younger citizens are the ones who will be responsible for their elderly parents ' health and well-being , therefore thier health and well-being should be prioritized.Based on a study by the .\n",
      "S Commonwealth Fund which is released on Wednesday , in the Healthday News/Detroit Free Press reports , which includes 4,052 U.S. adults ages 19 or older between September 2003 and January 2004 , about 16 million U.S. residents care for sick or disabled family members , and approximately nine million of those caregivers have medical problems , according to the study .\n",
      "S Three out of five caregivers said they had trouble paying their medical bills ( http : //www.medicalnewstoday.com ) .\n",
      "S This shows that in the course of taking care of their parents , the working adults do not take care of their own health , and what makes it worse is that they are financially in need , as evidenced by their incapability to settle their own healthcare bills .\n",
      "S Therefore as evidenced by these kinds of scenarios , the government should set aside more money on healthcare ,especially for working adults who are taking care for their elderly parents , since caregivers of the ill and unhealthy should be healthy in the first place .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the government has shown much concern to the elderly by investing a lot of money in their cause .\n",
      "S However , the amount of money invested way exceeds the amount they need .\n",
      "S Therefore , the amount of money that the government has obtained should be invested on the other important areas of development , such as education and healthcare .\n",

      "S ( Statistic Singapore , 2007 ) Since the population is unlikely to be able to replace itself in the near future ( The Business Time , 2007 ) , it is important to have policies that help to ease the ageing process by helping the elders to increase their retirement savings so as to lighten their dependency on the younger generation .\n",
      "S In February 2006 , the ministerial Committee on Ageing Issues proposed a polices such as the HDB 's rules of housing nucleus families closer to their elders , the Parents ' Maintenance act and higher retirement age , to protect the elders and ease old-age dependency .\n",

      "S In conclusion , the policies are not effective in helping the elders to ease their old-age dependency .\n",

      "S Besides introducing policies that help the elderly , people have to also change their attitude towards the aged to engage the elderly into the society and strive together to ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S The ramifications of ageing population have always been a challenge to many developed countries .\n",
      "S The immense social cost arises from ageing population can be attributed to mounting healthcare problem , diminishing of economic productivity and increasing accountability of younger generation towards the elderly .\n",

      "S With a carefully constructed policy , government agencies get to develop a holistic approach that meets the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S The diminishing of economic productivity due to ageing population may have an abysmal effect on a country .\n",
      "S Peter G. Peterson has claimed that later retirement could be a sensible method to maintain one nation 's productivity and reduce the dependency of elderly .\n",
      "S ( Peter G. Peterson , 2001 ) Singapore 's government has adopted this measure and raised the retirement age up to 62 to ensure elderly contribution to the society .\n",
      "S Moreover , such policy emphasizes the principle of self-reliance and reduces the burden and social cost of the community .\n",
      "S The existence of the older workforce not only increases the input of the economy but also enables elderly to gain some form of steady income .\n",
      "S This will ameliorate the deteriorating effect on a nation 's economy due to ageing progression .\n",
      "S However , this policy will remain fruitless without the collaboration between elderly , employers and the state .\n",
      "S Employers tend to discriminate elderly frequently as they are deemed to be vulnerable and unproductive .\n",
      "S In order to remove such prejudice , government provides incentives by reducing the employer 's contribution to elderly Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) .\n",
      "S Initially government will top up the remainder sum for the elderly so that the welfare of elderly will not be jeopardized .\n",
      "S Healthcare is another prevalent problem in a society where the number of elderly is increasing tremendously .\n",
      "S Elderly has a higher possibility to encounter a long-term management of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease .\n",
      "S Therefore it is essential for government to keep healthcare cost at an affordable rate for this vulnerable group .\n",
      "S Singapore 's government subsidizes heavily on medical service and grants some flexibility in the CPF system so that elderly can utilize part of their saving in the CPF account for hospitalization expenses .\n",
      "S In addition , family responsibility is always being stressed such that children are required to contribute to the Medisave account of their elderly member .\n",
      "S Transfer of fund from the Ordinary Account to parents ' Retirement Account is also available .\n",
      "S Such policies spread over the cost of ageing progression to family and community and minimize the state fiscal provision .\n",
      "S Moreover , in order to make medical service easily accessible to the needy , polyclinic which is an affordable subsidized one-stop health centre , offer outpatient medical care and pharmacy services .\n",
      "S This facilitates elderly who is bedridden and confined to wheelchairs .\n",
      "S Despite heavy subsidization on healthcare , elderly who is destitute without family support may still find medical service prohibitive .\n",
      "S As such , Public Assistance and Medifund have been introduced to assuage this problem whereby rigorous diagnosis is being carried out and relevant assistance will be given to the needy accordingly .\n",
      "S Lastly , the mentality health of elderly is exceptionally vital to enhance their social functioning and to maximize their potential .\n",

      "S ( Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005 ) Society should also shift their paradigm and not to equate elderly with social marginalization to maximize the social functioning of elderly .\n",
      "S In developed countries such as the United States , Japan and Singapore , the aging population has been an important issue .\n",
      "S The Singapore government has implemented policies which have helped to solve problems arising from the aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S The problems include a need for more health care services , increase in elder dependency on the government and draining the country 's resources .\n",
      "S However , due to the growing aging population , further research is necessary in order to cater to this growing segment .\n",
      "S I will explore in-depth in the policies implemented by the Singapore government in the social aspect .\n",
      "S One of the strategies from the text , \" elder dependency should be reduced by making people work longer \" ( Peter G. Peterson ) can be applied in the Singapore context whereby the retirement age has been raised from 60 to 62 in 1999 .\n",
      "S With longer working lives , people will be able to save more money for old age .\n",
      "S However , longer working lives may have implications on their health , which may lead to an increase in medical expenditure .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , this can be solved by the flexi-work hour program such that the elder group can work shorter hours and not ruin their health .\n",
      "S Moreover , based on a government survey conducted last July , more than 60 per cent of 25,000 unemployed older folk who planned to look for work preferred part time .\n",
      "S However , only 43 per cent of the employers are willing to offer flexible work to older workers , while 57 per cent are presumably against such arrangements .\n",
      "S Furthermore , figures from Ministry of Manpower show that the proportion of employees on flexible work arrangements in 2008 was 9.4 per cent from the public and private sectors .\n",
      "S Hence , I will suggest a development of new models of work which will be required as the workforce ages and employees search for greater flexibility in work organization .\n",
      "S This will encourage the elder group to return to the workforce and achieve a reduction of elder dependency on the government .\n",
      "S In Singapore , education has been a main concern and the government has implemented policies such as compulsory primary school education and subsidies for students from poor families .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in the 2009 Key Budget Initiatives , the government is enhancing school education by \" providing better facilities for an all-round education in every school , enhancing both the size and quality of the teaching force and bringing in allied educators into schools to collaborate with teachers in providing better attention for every child .\n",
      "S \" ( Key Budget Initiatives ) With a strong education system base , everyone has a chance to receive high level of education , which will secure them higher paying jobs in the future and also help to stimulate the country 's economic growth .\n",
      "S As a result , \" the cost burden can be spread over a larger and more affluent future generation \" .\n",
      "S ( Peter G. Peterson ) Nevertheless , one can argue that with a low birth rate , the system established will not be fully utilized .\n",
      "S However , education system is important in a country 's development for future generations , hence the government can only further revise the baby bonus policy in order to encourage families to have more children .\n",
      "S Another social problem will be elderly parents being abandoned at nursing homes or children living overseas and there is no one looking after their parents in Singapore .\n",
      "S However , recent study has found that \" seniors here are generally well cared for by their children \" .\n",
      "S Moreover , \" two in three respondents pay for their senior 's medical bills and keep them company \" .\n",
      "S ( The Straits Times Article ) On the other hand , there is also a setback such that there will be another generation of elderly who are not prepared for their own retirement .\n",
      "S The reason being their income will be used to support elderly parents , to cover family expenses and provide for their children .\n",
      "S However , with the CPF scheme in place , there should be savings when they reach retirement age , but I will suggest that research has to be conducted to find out how much people will need to save for their retirement and whether the current CPF contribution rate is sufficient .\n",
      "S Moreover , compulsory insurance scheme can be introduced to ensure more savings .\n",
      "S The government is also \" committing to a substantial expansion of the healthcare sector by investing $ 4 billion to restructure the heath care system to handle the aging population such as the development of community hospitals \" .\n",
      "S ( Key Budget Initiatives ) Patients can then recuperate at these community hospitals which generate savings and increase efficiency on treatment of more acute cases .\n",
      "S In evaluating the government policies , I do agree that these are workable solutions to a large extent .\n"

      "S For example , Chow and Chan 's study ( as cited in Lee , & Mehta , 2004 ) states that as families become more modernised , the level of the family social support to the old will suffer deterioration .\n",
      "S Without new policies and further research and development in all fields of study , relating to the aged , they will face difficulties in living their current environment .\n",
      "S Despite the complex changes in the environment , there are theories on successful aging which could help us in our investigation on to the extent of the current policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The following theories are role theory and social exchange theory .\n",
      "S The role theory suggests that people play specific roles in their families and communities throughout their life time .\n",
      "S With regards to social exchange theory suggests that the degree of interaction of elderly is determined by their ability to engage in social exchange .\n",
      "S We will focus on whether the current policies have made life easier for the elderly on the basis of these theories .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the existing policy on employing the elderly does not do enough to allow senior worker to continue playing their roles in working community .\n",
      "S Companies in Singapore tend to prefer employing younger employees , and when the company is undergoing restructuring , the older workers are usually the ones to be retrenched .\n",
      "S Despite the incentives given out by Singapore government to encourage companies to continue employing the elderly , companies still hesitate to keep them because of possible health problems .\n",
      "S Forcing them to accept less respected job , also mean lower income , to earn for a living as retirement age has increased .\n",
      "S This creates undue stress and negative psychological impact on the aged , at the same time a social stigma on them and also inadequate income .\n",
      "S A survey from MCYS ( 2005 ) shows that there is an increased in the proportion of those aged above 55 and above who found their income usually inadequate , 29.9 % of them credit it to low income .\n",
      "S Unlike Japan , the companies tend to treasure the experience of older workers and recognise their loyalty towards the company , allowing them to stay on to managerial position provided that they are competent .\n",
      "S The aged in Japan are very much respected as compared to those in Singapore , hence , aging with more dignity .\n",
      "S Taking a closer look , the success of the policy on employing the elderly is still inconclusive , as it takes years to change the perspective of a society .\n",
      "S At the very least , the elderly is still able to be part of the workforce .\n",
      "S To a large extent , most of the existing policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The HDB housing policy which encourages families to stay closer to their parents allows elderly to continue their role in helping their children or even an additional role as a grandparent .\n",
      "S The HDB provides additional grants through CPF for families to purchase flats within a certain radius of their parents .\n",
      "S With the close proximity , family members can travel to and fro with ease , helping them in terms of household matters and even taking care of young children .\n",
      "S This allows bonding to increase between them and also increasing the self-worth of the elderly .\n",
      "S In terms of improving the ability of the elderly in engaging social exchange , mobility and places are the important aspect .\n",
      "S The government is creating a more disabled and elderly friendly environment by making improvements in housing estates and public areas .\n",
      "S For example , the transport authority aims to have lift facilities in every mass rapid and light rail transit stations .\n",
      "S In order to encourage active aging , the government is bringing activities closer to housing estates like the RC or CC .\n",
      "S These activities include not only physical activities , and also voluntary activities .\n",
      "S The government also set up the Council for Third Age to further promote active aging ( MCYS , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Presently , though social policies are still solely draft out by the government .\n",
      "S However , Singaporeans can be involved in improving these policies by providing feedbacks through government portals like Reach .\n",
      "S With such initiatives , policies are now more focused in terms of improving the lives of Singaporean as a whole .\n",
      "S Aging population is now the uprising enigma that alarms the nation of its increasing elderly dependency and diminution of productivity .\n",
      "S The proportion of elderly Singapore residents aged 65 and above had increased from 7.4 % in 2003 to 8.5 % in 2006 .\n",
      "S The number shall increase further as the proportion of children below 15 years has steadily declined from 28 % in 1980 to 19.3 % in 2006 .\n",
      "S It is undeniable that Singapore is facing the emerging healthcare ramifications due to the aging process .\n",
      "S Thus , the healthcare medical advancement indubitably has a pivotal role in easing the aging progression .\n",
      "S Additional healthcare facilities and services are to be provided in line with the aging process .\n",
      "S The escalating figure of aging population will certainly increase the numbers of patients afflicted to intricate diseases such as Ischaemic heart diseases .\n",
      "S With aging population , the likelihood of patients suffering from multiple organ failure will start to augment too .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , the number of hospitalizations due to such medical conditions may amplify as well .\n",
      "S In order to rectify the homeward bound predicament , not only more elderly friendly facilities have to be constructed , but the critical care medical treatment and surgery is chiefly required too .\n",
      "S However , this could point out to be a major hitch as there is an emerging need for critical care programmes .\n",
      "S Various medical institutions should offer trainings and preparations to medical professional personnel to equip them with the necessity to countenance the upcoming crisis .\n",
      "S The progression of aging could be also alleviated with new and hi- tech medical advancement .\n",
      "S Since the 2003 , Singapore General Hospital has performed numerous robotic surgeries ever since the robotic surgical system , known as Da Vinci Surgical was introduce .\n",
      "S This has significantly augmented the precision of intricate surgeries as well as trimming down much of the risk faced by the patient during surgical operations .\n",
      "S With the marvel breakthrough of medical advancement , elderly members who are the ones that are commonly affiliated with healthcare problems are better furnished with finer medication procedures .\n",
      "S However , technology and science can not replace the need for healing relationships among the medical personnel and patients .\n",
      "S Dr Vivian Balakrishnan , Minister for States and National Development once says that while technology and science continue to alter medical procedures and techniques , health care at its core remains a high-touch profession .\n",
      "S Care is provided by people , not technology , buildings or drugs .\n",
      "S ( Dr Vivian Blakrishnan , 2002 ) Through caring interactions , patients especially the old and needy members can be emotionally and psychologically motivated to wrestle against the associated sickness .\n",
      "S Thus , healthcare professionals are required to constantly enhance their ability to communicate and care , not just mainly rely on the development of technology and science .\n",
      "S In addition , with the robust production of supplementary healthcare products nowadays , the level of personal healthiness of the elderly can be much maintained .\n",
      "S Taking healthcare products such as natural vitamins and mineral salts is able to build up one 's immunity system against viral and bacterial infections .\n",
      "S It is often said that prevention is better than cure .\n",
      "S These supplementary products not only can fortify one 's immunity system , but also improve one 's mind alertness and body vigor .\n",
      "S Elderly should be taking complementary healthcare products to strengthen their body against diseases as we well as retaining their mental alertness .\n",
      "S At this point one may wonder that whether the manufactured supplementary healthcare products are safe to be consumed as there are cases that the products are proven to be potentially health hazardous .\n",
      "S However , numerous measures have been imposed by authorities such as the Health Sciences Authority to insure that the merchandises are secured to be utilised .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , consumer themselves have to prudent when selecting the varieties of healthcare products .\n",
      "S In conclusion , progress of development in healthcare needs have to always be maintained at a high pace as the tempo of aging progression hastens .\n",
      "S More funds should be provided to increase more research and development in the pharmaceutical and medical sciences fields as well as importing more advance technologies .\n",
      "S This would largely aid in resolving the predicaments of declining personal health system that an aging population will encounter .\n",
      "S Peter G. Peterson concludes that global aging may still impose unsustainable fiscal and economic burden unless the developed countries confront the daunting problem of rising healtcare cost and how to set limits on healthcare .\n",
      "S ( Peter G. Peterson , 2001 ) Yet , insufficient healthcare development spending may degenerate the health standards of the nation and so , in turn reduces productivity even more significantly .\n",
      "S Public spending should therefore be more focus on providing excellent healthcare facilities and services which would benefits and eases the growing health crisis amidst the aging population .\n"

      "S In the recent years , besides many issues such as wars in the Middle East , financial crisis , terrorism , a fast-aging population has become an unprecedented problem which many countries have encountered , especially the developed ones .\n",
      "S This demographic change has lead to several serious consequences which not only challenge the whole society but also the government and policy makers .\n",
      "S Such a problem like this could not be solved overnight , but need to have a suitable long-term plan .\n",
      "S Although there are still arguments surrounding old age issues , it can be believed that much have been done to ease the aging process , particularly medical advancement and efficient social policies .\n",
      "S To begin with , it is no doubt that when a person becomes older , he will meet health problems , physically and mentally .\n",
      "S Therefore , better healthcare is one of the most important priorities when finding out solutions to help the elderly .\n",
      "S Most developed countries offer the long-term care including nursing home , day cares , home health care and hospice care , and upgrade the facilities as well as infrastructure in the medical sector .\n",
      "S In the Singapore context , there are some hospitals will be built such as Jurong General Hospital opened in 2015 , and Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun is under-constructed and will be opened in 2010 .\n",
      "S Furthermore , on the understanding that elder people need a longer time to recover , the Ministry of Health has launched a new model to set up a link between acute hospitals with community ones where patients can receive relevant care after discharged from the acute hospitals .\n",
      "S To illustrate this type of healthcare is Tan Tock Seng Hospital with Ren Ci Hospital as well as Changi General Hospital with St Andrew 's Community Hospital .\n",
      "S Shortly , with the development in medical aspect , it could be fairly assured that elderly healthcare would be improved .\n",
      "S Secondly , from a social and financial standpoint , the government and policy makers have generated many possible ideas to deal with a graying population .\n",
      "S A question has been set up in Straits Times lately \" Who cares for these when they grow old ? \" .\n",
      "S In fact , there are some older people having no child or being single , so it is more difficult for them in their old days .\n",
      "S To deal with this problem , conceived by the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , The Centre for Enabled Living is the first-top centre for persons needing care .\n",
      "S It is a centre to help the elderly not only with their daily life but also emotional life by providing many helpful services - for example Befriending , Neighbourhood Links and Senior Activity Centres , and so on .\n",
      "S Another solution to reduce elder dependency is The Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) system , a source of financial support to Singaporeans during retirement .\n",
      "S It is mandatory for every employee and employer to put some money of his income per month into CPF .\n",
      "S Besides , the government also encourages its citizens to work as long as possible and contribute to the CPF to have a good preparation and more financial security in old age .\n",
      "S On the other hand , some people still doubt whether or not the advancement or development has actually helped the aging population .\n",
      "S Although governments raise fund and increase budget to support the elderly , healthcare costs is still high and some of the treatments which apply new technologies and methods are so expensive that money they save will run out after a few days .\n",
      "S Another point is that some of the policies can only be efficient and useful in developed nations .\n",
      "S Due to the shortage of budget , many other social problems such as poverty , starvation , inflation , etc. developing or poor countries may not take many actions to help their older people .\n",
      "S Hence , there should be more effort to be done to solve these problems .\n",
      "S All things considered , it can be concluded that current development and policies have helped to ease the aging process in a certain degree .\n",
      "S Solving these problems is not an easy task and can not achieve in a short-run as well .\n",

      "S By generating economic growth for the country , the aged would also benefit .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Public spending refers to expenditure by government .\n",
      "S A principal source of revenue or income to pay for public spending is taxation .\n",
      "S ( Tiscali , 2009 ) Some of the other areas in the country 's development that require public spending are like social services and benefits , education , infrastructure and development projects like transport , housing and employment .\n",
      "S ( Anonymous , 2009 ) It is important for the government to spend in this area so that the country 's economy and social condition will improve .\n",
      "S Many argue that limiting public spending on the elderly would only leave individuals and their families to face issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .\n",
      "S By cutting expenditure on welfare programs for the elderly , individuals and families are more responsible for a larger share of the elderly costs .\n",
      "S They would need to provide the cost for their own old age dependency , according to Robert B. and Laura S. in Doomsday .\n",
      "S Besides , such costs may even be bigger than the original cost of running welfare programs for the elderly .\n",
      "S On the contrary , diverting public spending on other areas of the country 's development will expand its economic opportunities and improve social conditions .\n",
      "S Such financial and social problems would actually not be faced by the individual and families .\n",
      "S When there is more expenditure on social services and benefits , education , infrastructure and development projects , the country is capable of build a better economy for its people .\n",
      "S And with economic growth , the country becomes richer and the people enjoy a higher standard of living .\n",
      "S In fact , public spending on higher education pays off , especially in times of economic crisis or downturn ( Aisha , 2009 )\n",
      "S For example , the society becomes more educated and affluent as more money is being pumped to ensure higher education and people get higher income when they work .\n",
      "S In such a situation , the country becomes richer and there would not be a need to cut down on program benefits or raise taxes .\n",
      "S Henceforth , economic growth would ensure the continuation of welfare programs for the elderly in the long run .\n",
      "S The burden on the people to pay for higher taxes in the future would be lessened as the economy serve to benefit the aged .\n",
      "S In addition , limiting public spending on the aged would mean that individuals have to provide the cost for their own old age dependency .\n",
      "S This is a beneficial for the country as people learn to depend on themselves .\n",
      "S They would be able to able to work better , attain higher income so as to help support education , housing , social services and rising cost of transportation for themselves .\n",
      "S It would be more practical in a case when there is economic downturn and the government is not able to spend on the aged .\n",
      "S \" An aging population will push up pension and healthcare costs , forcing major increases in public spending that could slow economic growth in rich and poor countries .\n",
      "S \" ( Fox , 2009 ) Clearly , as Singapore experiences the problem of ageing population , it is important to generate economic growth for the country and benefit the aged .\n",
      "S Higher expenditure on areas like infrastructure and education , allows the country to achieve greater economic growth which this in turn solve the problems of aging population .\n",
      "S With better economic and social condition in the country , people would become richer and affluent .\n",
      "S This would then reduce the worries of individuals and their families about issues pertaining to education , housing , social services and transportation .\n",
      "S In today 's society , ageing population is increasingly a problem that many countries , such as Singapore , Sweden and Japan , are now facing .\n",
      "S An ageing population brings challenges but also opportunities for people to explore .\n",
      "S There is a need to put in place government policies and programmes to meet the emerging needs of an ageing population .\n",
      "S Therefore , I agree to reduce public spending on the aged so that more resources and funds will be allocated to other areas of development such as the economy , education , technology and general healthcare within the country but help for the aged should not be neglected as well .\n",
      "S People will learn to be self-reliance when their support is being limited , in this case , the funding for usage of healthcare and public facilities ; they will have to plan their future needs .\n",
      "S In the case of Singapore , the government implemented policies such as Medisave and Medishield , to \" force \" her citizens to set aside money and plan financially for their future .\n",
      "S This will help ease the burden on the government as the people are able to afford their own medical fees through their own savings .\n",
      "S Another scheme that Singapore government adopt is the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , people have to save a part of their salary every month , upon retirement , they are able to withdraw and use it for their old age .\n",
      "S Because of such schemes , the government has more resources to focus more on other developments of the country which are equally important ; this is to ensure competitiveness in this globalised world .\n",
      "S Therefore limiting public spending on the aged will reduce the dependency of the aged on the government and also to ensure continuous developments in other areas of the country .\n",
      "S Even though , family members are responsibility of taking care of their elderly , but due to the large allocation of resources and money for the aged , many assumed that the government will take care of all the elderly .\n",
      "S Some took advantage of the situation and make use of the low-cost medical facilities , this can be seen by the long queues at the polyclinics in Singapore .\n",
      "S This may lead to people who are in urgent need for medical consultation to be delayed which in turn , may cause serious consequences .\n",
      "S Financial help should be given to those really in the need , instead of allocating large amount of funds to all the elderly .\n",
      "S Many elderly are still able to work and support themselves , thus they do n't need the help of the government .\n",
      "S According to the one article , PM Lee said that \" the best way to keep health costs down is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle \" ( Channel News Asia 2009 ) .\n",

      "S Therefore , part of the public spending on the aged can be diverted to develop other sectors of the country , so as to ensure that the public spending is well-allocated .\n",

      "S More elderly friendly facilities along neighbourhood should be built and good values such as giving up seats to the elderly should be taught to the public to help the elderly get along with their daily lives .\n",
      "S Like in Singapore , there are priority seats for elderly so that they do not have to stand for long distances .\n",
      "S If money were to be diverted to other area of developments , the problem of ageing population will still persists , the situation might worsen as they may not know how to support themselves and cause even more social problems .\n",
      "S Therefore public spending is essential , it should not be limited to assist the developments of other areas of development and neglect the major problem of ageing population that many countries face .\n",
      "S However , many social problems caused by the elderly are mainly due to the lack of education .\n",
      "S More resources should be allocated to develop the country 's education system so as to ensure the continuous supply of good labour and also to educate the public the importance of self-reliance .\n",

      "S These sectors will in turn ensure the vibrancy of the country , which will lead to long lasting growth .\n",
      "S It is not wise to allocate large public spending on the aged due to social problems such as ageing population , but instead , set the sights further , tackle the root of the problem , which is to educate the public the way to plan financially for their future .\n",
      "S This will help to develop the country as a whole , as it diversifies the country 's development .\n",

      "S Each opinion has its own merits .\n",
      "S In my own opinion , I agree with the latter , for these following reasons .\n",
      "S Firstly , national budget should be spent on more essential areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S For example , more money should be spent on education than any other areas .\n",
      "S Education has an irrefutably important part of a country 's development .\n",
      "S Investing in education , in my opinion , is the key to growth of any country .\n",
      "S With a strongly educated workforce , the national economy would dramatically rise .\n",
      "S There are many ways to invest in education .\n",
      "S One of them is upgrading the facilities and the quality of teaching .\n",
      "S More money should be spent on re-constructing old buildings and build more needed ones ( laboratories and libraries system ) .\n",
      "S The upgrade of facilities is privileged , as it will be easier for students to acquire knowledge .\n",
      "S Also , more sport facilities should be built for healthy and entertaining purposes of students .\n",
      "S On the other hand , the governments should pay more attention to the teaching quality by using national budget to provide better results .\n",
      "S Inviting more good professors from overseas to come and join our teaching staffs could do this .\n",
      "S Secondly , the money of the country should also be used in improving health care .\n",
      "S More hospitals with better equipments should be built .\n",
      "S However , not only facilities but also the treatments of patients should also be improved .\n",
      "S This has again proved the point that I have proved before .\n",
      "S Better education results in better labours .\n",
      "S Hence , better labours in health , with assists from better facilities and equipments , will be the ideal workforce for national health care .\n",
      "S In fact , this is also a way to solve the heavy burden of aging process , because the elders are who need the supports of health care the most .\n",
      "S Last but not least , technological researches and new inventions are also what the government should pay attention to .\n",
      "S The development of technology and its effects has always been one of the most important factors that totally change the way we lived from the past .\n",
      "S More and more inventions are made in order to enhance the basis of our daily life .\n",
      "S Such improvements indisputably made our lives more enjoyable and our works more effective .\n",
      "S These researches and inventions can cover numerous aspects of the country .\n",
      "S Technology improvements will intensify the educational level , the quality of health care , the living standards , etc... To some extent , these strategies also indirectly assist the elders .\n",
      "S With some of my points that are listed above , I think my idea is not considered as telling the old people \" To go and die faster \" .\n",
      "S Rather , what I try to point out is that even the national budget is spent on other fields , it still indirectly benefit the elders .\n",

      "S ) With such a sizeable amount of aged in a small country like Singapore , it will definitely have many socio-economic implications on Singapore , thus the government should generate more public polices to care for this group of people in the years to come .\n",
      "S Because this group of people will generally make up a significant amount in our population , government should divert more funds to improve on its healthcare system and also upgrade our infrastructure and facilities to cater to an older population .\n",
      "S In fact , our local government is already preparing Singapore to a new paradigm of aging as can be seen from the funding of projects such as the building of Studio Apartments , which is specially built to cater to the needs of the aged .\n",
      "S These apartments have special facilities that look after the elderly such as lifts stopping at every floor and handgrips built around the flat so that it is more convenient and safer for the elderly .\n",
      "S Hence , public spending should not be limited , in fact we should even divert more funds to similar projects that will cater to the needs of an older population as they will after all make up a significant amount in Singapore , thus more focus should be placed on them .\n",
      "S In addition , public spending should not be limited as more funds should be dedicated to improve the healthcare systems by building more nursing homes and also hospitals for the aged as old age will usually be an age that is more prone to illnesses and diseases .\n",
      "S Therefore we will need a large pool of specialise trained nurses and caretakers to look after them .\n",
      "S This can be seen in the building of more nursing homes and encouraging more people to take up professions relating to this field so as to increase the number of trained professionals with accordance to the increase in older population in our society .\n",
      "S Therefore , aging population is an issue that we can not afford to neglect and public policies should adapt to this new demographic trend by focusing more on the increasing older population size , hence more funds should be dedicated to projects which will better prepare Singaporeans for an aging population .\n",
      "S However , although aging population is a serious issue that will affect the productivity and competitiveness of Singapore , we should also note that the aging of a population is happening not only in Singapore but around the world as well .\n",
      "S It is a natural consequence of economic development which extends life spans and lower birth rates .\n",
      "S Hence , government should not over focus on this issue and throw in excessive funds in this area as this will inhibit the growth of other sectors as funds can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development such as investment and building better infrastructure to strive towards our goal of becoming a world class global city .\n",
      "S Singapore is never a welfare state to begin with ; the government has adopted policy to ensure self-reliance such as the introduction of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) which makes it compulsory for all Singapore citizens to save for future use .\n",
      "S Hence , it is impossible for our government to provide welfare and pension for everyone , thus the Medisave Scheme under Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) was introduced which make it compulsory for all Singaporeans to set aside 6-8 % of their salary to put into their personal account that can be used to pay for hospital fees .\n",
      "S Members of the CPF must keep a minimum of $ 17,000 in their Medisave account to pay for medical expenses .\n",
      "S According to statistics , the average active member 's balance in 1994 was S $ 73,816 which shows how efficient the CPF saving scheme is .\n",

      "S ) Therefore with such policy in place , public spending on the aged is already limited in this sense .\n",
      "S Similarly , the government also promotes life long employability which can be seen from the extension of retirement age from 62 to 65 years old , this is to ensure that the aged can accumulate more wealth before retiring when they are still able to work therefore reducing the public spending of our government on the aged .\n",
      "S In addition to all these policies , filial piety and greater familial support is also emphasised as the government encouraged the children to take care of their parents when they are older as this will ease the funding of the government for each and every of the elderly , but instead only focused on the needy elderly who has no children to look after them .\n",
      "S Hence in conclusion , aging population is a natural occurrence due to low birth rates and higher life expectancy , therefore the government should not reduce on their public spending on the aged , but should however increased to an extent whereby it able to provide the necessary care for the aged , especially to those who do not have any children to rely on .\n",
      "S However , over focusing on this situation may inhibit the growth of our economy as these precious funds can be diverted to other uses especially in the area of development .\n",
      "S One should also identify the fact that Singapore is not a welfare state in the first place , and the policies were shaped more to self reliance than relying on government to take care of them when they are older , thus in this context , it is possible to justify the point that public spending should not be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S As Singapore 's total fertility rate ( TFR ) decreases year by year , we are in increasing danger of having an ageing population in the very near future .\n",
      "S As of 2007 , Singapore 's TFR is 1.29 which is well below the replacement level of 2.1 .\n",
      "S The old-age support ratio has also decreased to 8.5 ( 2007 ) from 17.0 ( 1970 ) .\n",
      "S This trend suggests that Singapore is confronted with the problem of a rapidly fast aging population .\n",
      "S Singapore 's TFR is getting lower and lower every year because more Singaporeans are settling down at a later age .\n",
      "S They are putting more focus on their careers first .\n",
      "S Couples are also giving birth to fewer babies , opting for smaller families to have a higher level of income .\n",
      "S As the aging population in Singapore increases , more and more money have to be allocated to the aging population .\n",
      "S I feel that public spending on the aged should be given more attention and more funds , as for the long-term , the aging population could potentially become a major problem .\n",
      "S Public spending could be focused more on giving incentives for couples to have bigger families .\n",
      "S As Singapore 's TFR is very low , the government could do more to encourage couples to give birth .\n",
      "S The government could give higher monetary incentives for families who have more children .\n",
      "S Singapore has a high standard of living , thus it is expensive to raise a child .\n",
      "S The government could divert more money to the \" Baby Bonus Scheme \" , as it seems the incentives are not enough at the moment for Singaporean families to want to have a bigger family .\n",
      "S If the incentives work , there will be more youths in the future , this will help to ease the financial burden of the elderly .\n",
      "S There would be more people supporting the old and the aged would be better taken care of .\n",
      "S If the TFR is higher , there would also be more people to work in the future , contributing more to the economy and sustaining its high growth .\n",
      "S This would also mean that the government would not need to worry about spending more money to recruit people for national defense , as there would be enough young people to defend the country in the future .\n",
      "S This is one reason why money can be spent more on other areas for the country 's development instead on the aged .\n",
      "S Public spending towards encouraging higher birth rates .\n",
      "S In the near future , it is inevitable that Singapore will have an aging population .\n",
      "S To tackle the problem , public spending should be given more to the aged .\n",
      "S The government could set up more schools to train the elderly new skills , these new skills would allow more opportunities for the elderly to find jobs .\n",
      "S The government could also give more subsidies for the aged .\n",
      "S This will help ease their cost of living as many of them could be unemployed and unable to cope with the higher cost of living .\n",
      "S There should also be more public spending on elderly health care .\n",
      "S As the elderly are prone to more serious illnesses , some would not be able to pay their medical bills .\n",
      "S The lower number of working people would mean that the elderly would be more dependent on fewer people , these people would be heavily burdened .\n",
      "S The aging population would need more public spending as their dependents would be smaller and heavily burdened .\n",
      "S They would need more subsidies and monetary help to continue to lead a comfortable life .\n",
      "S The government could also spend more money on the health sector in general .\n",
      "S They should concentrate public spending on the health sector , on research and improvement of technology , promoting better and cheaper health care .\n",
      "S This would improve the lives of everyone in general and also help to give cheap and good health care for the elderly .\n",
      "S Public spending for the health care sector would benefit everyone and could prove to be very effective .\n",
      "S To conclude , I feel that public spending on the aged is very important .\n",
      "S Singapore 's population is increasingly becoming an aging population , it would be a problem that we can not ignore .\n",
      "S Good long-term planning is essential to solve this problem of the aged and public spending on the aged is very crucial , it can not be neglected .\n",
      "S The government could also spend more money on giving incentives to encourage more families to have more children .\n",
      "S This would be good for the economy in the future , and would also result in more people to support the elderly .\n",
      "S If this fails , public spending on the aged is the only option and more money should be diverted to it instead of the other areas .\n",
      "S \" Over the past two decades , journalists and scholars have periodically commented on how rising public spending for older people is expected to threaten if not erode public commitments to other deserving groups .\n",
      "S \" said Paul W. Newacheck ( Health Affairs , 2004 ) .\n",
      "S Public spending is money expended from the government to pay for the country 's expenses ( Business Dictionary , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S The money can come from different sources , with the majority coming from taxation .\n",
      "S For instance , the tax policy in Singapore is drawn out based on the notion of guiding desirable behaviour towards different economic and social goals .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending should not emphasize only social , but also economic development of the country .\n",
      "S However , there are many emerging concerns about the ageing society in many developed countries .\n",
      "S Limiting public spending for the aged may in turn bring about social problems ; major issues regarding family responsibilities and dignity .\n",
      "S As the percentage of the aged increases , the percentage of people generating income in the country diminishes .\n",
      "S Without the government to shoulder part of the burden , most immediate families of the elderly will find it financially taxing on their part .\n",
      "S In worse cases , cash-strapped children will be unwilling to take care of them due to the high standards of living and healthcare costs increasing each year .\n",
      "S This problem falls back on society , as abandoned parents will be left to fend for themselves ( Megawati Wijaya , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S A research in Singapore shows that the Geylang East Home for the Aged , a shelter for elderly abandoned by their family , said that its 37-bed home is always full .\n",
      "S In many cases , the families of these abandoned aged just passed their responsibility to another institution .\n",
      "S ( Avia Collinder , 2008 ) Also , I feel that most elderly people have a strong sense of dignity and self worth , considering their lifelong achievements and efforts throughout the years ( Nordenfelt L , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S These people are most probably not going to turn to government 's aid even if their own families reject them .\n"

      "S Without the government 's initiatives , the elderly people are going to go through a hard time coping in the society .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , it still can be argued that directing public spending to other areas of the country 's development can indirectly offset these social problems .\n",
      "S With the flexibility to invest in other areas , we can empower these three groups of people : Employers , families and the elderly .\n",
      "S Firstly , this amount of money can be used to help businesses and individuals struggling from the recent economic crisis .\n",
      "S For instance , the government implemented the Job Credit Scheme in Singapore .\n",
      "S This scheme was introduced to preserve jobs during the economic downturn .\n",
      "S Basically , participating employers will receive a cash grant based on the CPF contributions they have made for their existing employees .\n",
      "S ( IRAS , 2009 ) It serves as a winning tool as the employers get to bring their businesses to a higher level , and the existing workers in turn retain their jobs .\n",
      "S In this way , these benefiters can fulfill their basic responsibilities better , in taking care of their own families with the higher purchasing power they have .\n",
      "S Secondly , education and learning are important factors attributing to one country 's success .\n",
      "S With the society changing constantly , the monetary support which the government can provide is only temporary .\n",
      "S Often , people need to improve themselves to keep up with the demands and needs of their surrounding milieu .\n",
      "S For example , investing on current employees to advance their expertise in the workplace can land them with better promotion prospects and job security .\n",
      "S Equipping the younger generation with relevant skills can also allow them higher chances of securing better jobs of their preferences in the future .\n",
      "S Also , the government can educate these people about their responsibilities by emphasizing the role of the family in caring for the elderly ( Megawati Wijaya , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S With better jobs and increase in income , they can help the families in coping with the high standards of living and spiraling healthcare costs for the aged .\n",
      "S As a result , social stability can be fulfilled while economic growth is being spurred .\n",
      "S Lastly , investments can be made on healthcare to empower the aged to take charge of their own health .\n",
      "S Research studies in New York showed that living a healthy lifestyle is very important to the elderly people in their journey of conquering new physical , emotional and mental challenges ( Admin in Aging , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S The level of physical activity needed to be exerted for beneficial results is attainable by majority of the aged ( Gerontology , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S The government can also hold \" Healthy Lifestyle \" campaigns to encourage the aged to engage more actively , and promote healthy aging .\n",
      "S On top of that , the involvement of their immediate families in the process will be a bonus in helping them cope with ageing .\n",
      "S With a blissful mind and a healthy body , these elderly will be less likely to seek emotional and social help from the government .\n",
      "S All in all , limiting public spending on the aged and directing on other areas of development such as businesses , education and healthcare is more rewarding then just focusing on the needy groups .\n",
      "S Although the help is theoretically superficial , it is indirectly helping the society to deal with the ageing society more effectively than using the monetary support , which is a temporary solution .\n",
      "S This solution is made much easier when we understand the bigger picture .\n",
      "S If we do not pay attention to the long term effects the problem is going to cause , we will risk the possibility of allocating the limited resources for the wrong usage .\n",
      "S It is well-known that there are various areas of country 's development which demand substantial expenditure from public spending such as urban development , infrastructure projects , biomedical research , edbiz , and so on .\n",
      "S Abundant financial resources are alloted to each area mentioned above , since the development of these areas are essential in national construction and facilitate the prosperity of economy .\n",
      "S However , accompanying the aging population , much public spending including pension and health provision is expended on the aged .\n",
      "S More and more elderly people , especially some of those who can not take care of themselves , empty nesters , other special groups , as well as their families have a greater demand for pension services , which requires social services to provide old-age pension ( Wu Li Min , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , the public spending on the aged should not be limited so that it guarantees the welfare of the aged and protects their rights and benefits .\n",
      "S The aged might have devoted their youth and even their whole life to serving the society , public spending on the aged is therefore necessary .\n",
      "S In fact , every one of us either doing mental or physical work , have made a significant contribution towards the development of society .\n",
      "S One 's life to go through a juvenile , youth , middle-aged and older period is an irresistible law of nature .\n",
      "S Hence , as long as a person has sacrificed for the social development , then , when he is old and no longer contribute his own force in his area of work , the state government should give him his deserved rewards by taking care of their future .\n",
      "S If the public spending on the aged is limited , the burden on the children or younger generation will be much heavier since they have to bear more expenses of their parents .\n",
      "S It was claimed that families and individuals will face many issues if welfare programs are cut or restructured ( Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S A survey in China showed that \" living and working pressure makes people powerless to take care of their parents \" has become a great difficulty for young people now ( Wang Jun , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S In today 's society , many people of working age , with their own careers and families , withstand considerable economic pressure .\n",
      "S Once the elderly reach their old age , it is followed by a variety of ailments .\n",
      "S Expensive medical and health care costs other than the very high daily cost indeed cause a more serious difficulty .\n",
      "S So when the children have to bear the medical expenses and the costs of everyday life of their parents , they tend to live beyond their income .\n",
      "S The gap between the rich and the poor in the present society is still apparent that when the government subsidies reduce , high-income groups of retired people may still have an easy life , but the relatively poor people will face even tougher difficulties of livelihood .\n",
      "S Higher income people tend to have more savings , so that they can enjoy a carefree retirement .\n",
      "S However , low-wage sectors of the population in general do not have much savings since they even face insufficiencies of money during daily life .\n",
      "S To the later years , if they encounter ungrateful children who are unwilling to take care of them , then how do they spend their remaining days ?\n",
      "S Many people today spend money on their own organized families , to meet the needs of their children , as well as the pursuit of material comfort of their own instead of taking out money to supply their parents .\n",
      "S At this point , a notion of \" Parental Support Law \" has been suggested to force the children to be filial to their parents ( Huang Yu Shan , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S However , children ' support for their elderly parents is a kind of moral value and the performance of the human behavior norms under the education system .\n",
      "S If law is to require people to support their parents , does it mean that our moral values have to deteriorate to such an extent ?\n",
      "S Clearly , the public spending on the aged should be conserved to protect the rights and benefits of the aged .\n",
      "S The aged have dedicated so much to the development of country that they should be thanked .\n",
      "S Reduced public spending will increase the burden of the children and furthermore , poor people will become poorer .\n",
      "S We should care for the aged despite only considering for the sake of economic interests .\n",
      "S In fact , we all grow old one day .\n",
      "S According to Singapore Department of Statistic , the life expectancy of Singaporean has increased noticeably to 78.0 for male and to 82.8 for female ( as cited from Press Release , Singapore Department of Statistic , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Although that is good news proving for Singapore 's success ; as other developed nations , it also leads to some unpleasant consequences for Singapore such as raising the financial burden for elderly-caring .\n",
      "S From my perspective , economic development is not only the key factor easing the aging but also is the key solution for some serious problems caused by this process .\n",
      "S First of all , judging this issue from one particular angle , it is commonly believed that well-funded life which rises from economic success will help people to be able to purchase sufficient food for their own demands .\n",

      "S At last , the rapid development of nation 's economy not only makes the aging slow down but also partially solves its annoying consequences .\n",
      "S Among of its consequences , Peter G. Peterson on the article \" A Gray World \" raised his concern on the huge expenses for elderly caring services ( Peter G. Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S To my way of thinking , economic factors should be the most considerable solution .\n",
      "S As discussed above , financial sufficiency can urge the improvement of the other factors .\n",

      "S In addition , financial factors are also incentives for long-life working , as they can support the current life and save more for the rest of life if they decide to keep working .\n",
      "S There is a citation from Frank Field , British chairman of the all-party committee : \" If you look at life expectancy in 1948 , when the state pension was introduced , and take that as a reasonable length of time to receive a pension , you would have a retirement age of 74 today .\n",

      "S In fact , the development of economy itself can not wholly solve the problems , and it needs more complex solution among social , political and economical factors .\n",
      "S However , economic issue should be first-top considered in any topic relating to the aging process .\n",
      "S In conclusion , today developed countries have been increasingly confronted with the aging process and its consequences .\n",
      "S In the common thought , all economics , science , social policy contribute to easing this process but economic factor attracts most of our concerns as it should be viewed as the most important one .\n",
      "S All things are considered , a prosperous economy not only lengthens the life expectancy but also make people live more healthily and lighten social burden on elderly-caring .\n",
      "S While the population is shifting towards a greying one , many would start to worry about the ease of aging in the current society , especially amidst the time of financial crisis and difficulty .\n",
      "S Current research and development such as medical advancement and barrier free housing estates are examples that have helped ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , more emphasis should be placed on the development of social policy helping to alleviate and address concerns such as the lack of financial support and social care , as it affects the elderly more directly .\n",
      "S Meanwhile , there are already policies in place , such as the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , Lease Buy Back Scheme ( LBS ) and housing grants for married children staying near parents , which are all structured to aid the aged in terms of financial and healthcare issues .\n",
      "S Central Provident Fund is a savings account for all workers in Singapore to set aside a sum of 33 percent of their wages for retirement purposes while working .\n",
      "S This sum of money will serve as a source of income when one can not work in the future due to old age .\n",
      "S On top of that , a subset of the CPF called the Medisave account , will serve as a backup sum to pay for any medical bills should the need arises .\n",
      "S Thereby , they would not have to strain their pockets to pay for healthcare when they have already stopped working .\n",
      "S At this juncture , one may wonder how could the Medisave account be sufficient when medical fees these days are so steep .\n",

      "S However , this could be solved by purchasing Medishield or third party healthcare insurance using the Medisave itself .\n",

      "S With these in place , the aged will be well taken care of and have a peace of mind , in monetary aspect , living in a more comfortable environment during old age .\n",
      "S For those elderly who have funds but are locked in the area of housing assets , have a solution too .\n",
      "S Just recently in March 2009 , the government has introduced the Lease Buy Back Scheme ( LBS ) for elderly to sell off their tail end thirty years lease of their flats in return for life-long monthly retirement income .\n",
      "S These elderly will stand to enjoy a supplement to their retirement income on top of what they are receiving from CPF payout .\n",
      "S Depending on the age group , an amount ranging from $ 500 to $ 800 will be issued to them monthly after an upfront sum of $ 5000 .\n",
      "S Again , we can see how public policy has shaped to help the elderly have a less financial taxing aging process .\n",
      "S Apart from being well taken care of in medical bills , the social well-being of the aged is taken into consideration as well .\n",
      "S It is in the government 's interest that these elderly do receive an appropriate amount of attention and care so that they will not be deprived of company at old age .\n",
      "S This is why the Housing Development Board ( HDB ) came up with a housing grant of forty thousand dollars to encourage the housing of nucleus family members near their parents .\n",
      "S The policy will not only benefit the purchaser in cutting cost but will also help to propagate the importance of filial obligation in the society .\n",
      "S When the married children are housed near to their parents , they are more likely to visit them frequently due to convenience and simultaneously , the elderly will be taken care of physically as well .\n",
      "S Opponents of this position may argue that the opposite may take place instead .\n",
      "S Rather than having the married couple to look after their parents , it might be the children exploiting the convenience of their parents , living off them or even increasing the burden on them such as treating them as babysitters for their own children .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , taking this situation from another point of view actually aligns with the government 's aim : fostering mutual care between the young and elderly .\n",

      "S Introduction\n",
      "S It is always a thorny issue when it comes to allocation of the budget pie for the country 's development .\n",
      "S Whether is it for educational , economical , societal or military advancement , it is of paramount importance that policy makers make suitable decisions in the best interests of the country and its people .\n",
      "S In my opinion , channeling too much government funds to taking care of the aged can have detrimental effects on the country 's development .\n",
      "S Therefore , I am for the statement that public spending on the aged should be limited .\n",
      "S Uncontrolled government spending on healthcare or infrastructure for the aged could result in other groups of needy people not getting their share of the government 's financial aid .\n",
      "S These include the handicapped , juvenile delinquents and low income families .\n",
      "S These less privileged groups of people are also members of the society who require our assistance .\n",
      "S Not attending to their needs may have serious impact on the society .\n",
      "S People from low income families struggling to make ends meet may be desperate and might resort to robbery and burglary to ease their financial burden .\n",
      "S Teenagers who engage in unlawful behaviours that defy established criminal codes or deviate from societal norms may continue with their misbehaviours such as running away from school or home , or even petty crimes , if they fail to receive help from respective government bodies and the community .\n",
      "S These are complex social problems that might significantly impact other members of the society , and hence , development of the country , if not handled appropriately .\n",
      "S Many may argue that the elderly are also equally , if not , more in need of the funds , especially since they were once economically active , it 's only right that their welfare is being taken care off now that they have lost the ability to take care of themselves .\n",
      "S In addition , some would argue that it is of social obligation that this should be done .\n",
      "S But , like many countries , Singapore does not have a pension system for the retired old aged .\n",
      "S If the responsibility of taking care of the aged falls solely on the government , the huge increase in fiscal budget will not be an amount the existing workforce and taxpayers can meet .\n",
      "S Public funding is also required in the development of our education sector as Singapore continue to establish herself as an education hub .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the importance of education can not be over emphasized .\n",
      "S Large amount of funds are pumped into the education sector so that the younger generation can receive the best education .\n",
      "S These could be in the form of better school sports and laboratory facilities , more funding for enrichment courses or even upgrading of school compound to accommodate more students .\n",
      "S On the hindsight , funding could also imply subsidies for needy students .\n",
      "S Students under Finance Assistant Scheme ( FAS ) could be provided with school uniforms , school shoes and basic school materials .\n",
      "S Merit bursaries and scholarships can be awarded to students who excelled in their academic and exhibit positive traits and qualities in other aspects of their life .\n",
      "S Singapore also has a mandatory six years Primary Education for all Singaporean .\n",
      "S Financial aid will be needed to ensure that poor families , who can not afford to send their children to school , could do so .\n",
      "S The ministry stands by the notion that no deserving student should be deprived of education .\n",
      "S As former president of the United State of America once said , \" Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education .\n",
      "S The human mind is our fundamental resource .\n",
      "S \" It is clear that education is one of the key aspects for the progress of a nation .\n",

      "S In what ways can the health system adapts to the needs of the aged who have a higher probability of having chronic diseases .\n",

      "S No doubt , country is working on policies that can help to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , for policy makers their main objectives are to think of policies and developments which can help the country in expansion or to ensure that it will not hinders economic growth .\n",
      "S In order for country expansion , policy makers are working on developments that can provide a valuable \" public product \" such as education and infrastructure .\n",
      "S The development on education sector will enable the further generations to be more educated and to possess a higher level of skills .\n",
      "S Next , development on the infrastructure will attract more foreign investors to set up companies in the country .\n",
      "S With development in both education and infrastructure , foreign investors will choose to set up their companies in a country with a pool of talents and with great infrastructure with this it can boost up the country economics .\n",
      "S Nevertheless working policies and development to ease the aged can help with the country expansion .\n",
      "S This can be achieve by emphasize in increasing and raising more productive children in the further generation as mention \" by raising more productive children so that the cost burden is spread over a larger and more affluent future generation \" ( Paterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Raising and increasing productive children not only can , attract foreign investors to invest in a country with pool of talents and the burden of looking after the aged population is being spread out with prosperous further generations .\n",
      "S At such , a win- win situation can be achieved as we not only ease the aged population but also assist in country expansion .\n",
      "S Next , advancement in technological tools is required to ensure the sustainability of the health care system .\n",
      "S These technological tools are developed to make life of the aged easier , less stressful and even healthier for them to continue live independently .\n",
      "S For example , monitoring systems are currently researched to allow the aged to remain in their homes longer even they are being treated with chronic diseases , rather than moving them into a nursing home which may incurred more costs .\n",
      "S Lastly , research in life science areas has show ways to prolong human life and to prevent illness .\n",

      "S Researchers have suggests minimum exposure to oxidative conditions actually offer protection from acute doses .\n",
      "S With the research and advancement in life sciences to prolong human life and prevention of illness can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care .\n",
      "S In conclusion , research , development and policies help to ease the aging process is relative important .\n",
      "S For instance , increase and raising productive children not only can reduce the cost burden spread but also to attract foreign investors to invest in the country with pool of talent .\n",
      "S Secondly , technology advancement will enable the aged to live independently even they suffered with chronic diseases and their children can spend more time to focus on their work .\n",
      "S Lastly , research in life sciences to prolong life can help to reduce the fiscal costs on heath care and prevent illness .\n",
      "S Therefore , we must pay attention to focus on current research , development and policies to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Government usually faces problems caused by aging population .\n",
      "S Problems such as shrinking workforce and increased need in healthcare support have been exerting pressures on government spending .\n",
      "S As the national budget is limited , decisions on the allocation of resources have to be made regularly to create a better livelihood for its people whom include the young , the working adults and the aged .\n",
      "S Despite the important role played by government in ensuring the well being of the aged , there should be a balance in maintaining its social presence to prevent the elderly from over relying them .\n",
      "S Moreover , in an Asian society like Singapore , it is also the moral obligations of children to perform filial piety towards their parents financially and emotionally .\n"

      "S However , it is futile to have a skilled and knowledgeable workforce without sufficient job opportunities and career advancements .\n",

      "S Alternatively , it can fund small-medium enterprises which encourage entrepreneurship as well as career advancements .\n",

      "S For instance , the policy that advocates late retirement means that the working period of the citizen is extended beyond the usual age of 55 and 60 .\n",
      "S Although it aims for the greater good , by providing the elderly with greater self sufficiency , it is more harmful in the long term because the most critical issue here is the health of the elderly persons .\n",
      "S They are often unable to withstand high stress of the mind and the body that these work require and fall ill frequently .\n",
      "S The policy of passing laws that make it a must for children to look after their elderly parents is also much speculated over .\n",

      "S However , it is unquestionable that technology has contributed on a massive scale in helping the aged .\n",
      "S The SANYO technical review reveals the existence of \" systems that remind the elderly person to take their medicine ; systems that detect when he/she is in the room , so that electricity costs can be minimised .\n",

      "S Another invention is a telephone that utilises voice speed control technology .\n",
      "S This technology allows the aged person to slow down the speed at which the person on the other side is speaking .\n",

      "S It is particularly useful for those who are old and who live alone .\n",
      "S The possibilities of technology are endless .\n",
      "S In addition , I am an advocate of the social policy that deems it necessary for all citizens to put aside a small percentage of their monthly salary , during the working period of their lives .\n",
      "S For this seems to be a rather effective policy , with the value-added element of being able to lighten the economic burden supported by the government otherwise .\n",
      "S It consequently does ease the aging process , for the elderly person need not be at the mercy of others to obtain full medical care and other comforts .\n",
      "S Another policy suggests that money be invested in the educational system , so that more productive children are raised , \" resulting in a larger and more affluent future generation \" ( Peter Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S I feel that this is the key solution to easing the aging process , for a more productive younger generation means that all costs required to keep the aged healthy and comfortable can be borne by this efficient younger workforce .\n",
      "S Hence , the progress of the world in aspects of technology , economy and social policies have by far and large proven to be beneficial to the elderly gentleman of today 's society .\n",
      "S It has made his life after retirement one of relaxation , with comforts close at hand , always .\n",

      "S In addition , the people who belong to the working class are not the ones who are most vulnerable to the economic crisis .\n",
      "S The elderly is the more vulnerable group in this situation due to the fact that they are not capable of generating income to provide for themselves .\n",
      "S This is attributed to the fact that employers are constantly seeking people with higher productivity .\n",

      "S In contrast , I feel that in Singapore 's context , limiting public spending and diverting money to the country 's Education & Architecture in order to address the long term aging population issue is viable .\n",

      "S By 2025 this ratio is forecast to be 0.59 people under 20 for every person older than 65 \" ...we can observe that the dramatically increasing proportion of elderly will have tremendously wide impacts on our society .\n",
      "S Firstly , The elderly seem to be burdensome for young generation for the young must share their budgets to take care of the elder .\n",
      "S Secondly , the increase of the elder 's rate can cause trouble in health care costs which means more funds used for maintaining healthy life for no-more-able-working portion in society .\n",
      "S Therefore , we must have some solutions to solve this critical problem .\n",
      "S Let take a look in Singapore policies nowadays .\n",
      "S Based on the estimation of 7 % percent of Singapore 's population is over 65 currently and foreseen estimation about 19 % by 2030 ( cited in Asian Metacare research paper ) .\n",
      "S Under the thread of bearing the burden of aging , the Singapore 's government implements some policies such as constructing the new infrastructures for the elder and for the next generations also .\n",
      "S Besides , the policy makers also plant to extend the financial security of the elderly through either rising the working age or prolonging the retirement bursaries .\n",
      "S Those policies are easing gradually the aging process for they create good conditions to the elder who would be likely thought as useless elements in society have more opportunities to contribute their productive labour and have more happiness for the rest of their life .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the improvement of healthcare system is also lightening the aging burden .\n",
      "S More and more medication innovation has applied to extend the expectation of life so that the working-age has been lengthened consequently .\n",
      "S As the result , the productivity of citizen has also increased rapidly which leads to the increase in national revenue .\n",
      "S Despite of the disagreement among economists about the cost of investing money in developing new technologies and drugs for maintaining good heath for the elder , the investment in health care is profitable and wise .\n",
      "S When the elderly workers have more choices to keep their healthy lives longer , they are eager to become potential consumers for medical care ; therefore , the national budget will grow tremendously which relatively increase a big amount of GDP rate ( cited in the \" Government will control media cost ?\n",
      "S \" Article ) .\n",
      "S So the fact that the governments put efforts to develop health care system is logical and actually they have done well .\n",
      "S For example , according to the National Bureau of Economic Research study by economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Christian Hagist : \" the study found that the annualized rate of growth in government spending on health care was not only tops in the U.S. , at 6.23 percent , but that the rate of growth here was the fastest relative to increases in gross domestic product among the 10 countries studied .\n",
      "S That 's one reason why today the U.S. devotes about 16 percent of it domestic product to health care , compared to an average of less than 9 percent in other industrialized countries \" .\n",
      "S Hence , the USA spent money on nursing , building hospitals and strengthening clinical care for the elder .\n",
      "S Likewise , in Singapore , the government spends S $ 110 million to pay basic Medishield premiums for two years for Singaporeans aged 61 to 69 so that 90 % of the elder can have health care benefits ( cited in Asian metacare paper ) .\n",
      "S In short , from the economical and social points of view , we can conclude that the elder have been taken care of well than in the past by the improvement of technological equipments , healthy care systems and the serious awareness of the governments .\n",
      "S The elder must be respected because they are the factor to make the society be better-off in either economics or society .\n",
      "S As the result , we should continue to put efforts in dealing with the aging process issue .\n",

      "S Some have argued that public spending on the aged is redundant as the productivity and contributions of the aged to the nation is questioned .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending on the aged should be diverted to other areas of the country 's development due to the potential fruitful returns from these investments .\n",
      "S However , the assumption that the aged is non productive is untrue due to the increasing emphasis on healthcare .\n",
      "S This allowed the aged to remain healthy and continue working hence they are able to remain productive despite their age .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged is crucial in ensuring the continuance productivity of the aged which in turn benefits the country .\n",

      "S As a result , the health of the elderly can deteriorate as they may not seek treatment due to the inability to pay the medical bills .\n",
      "S The economy in turn suffers due to the threats on the productivity of the aged .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government should not neglect the healthcare benefits for the aged as the consequence is undesirable .\n"

      "S Moreover , the younger generations will come under heavy pressure due to the disparity ratio support of the aged .\n",
      "S To lighten this pressure , public spending such as healthcare benefits can help lighten the financial burden faced by the younger generation .\n",

      "S The aging process has indeed become a phenomenon in Singapore .\n",
      "S This is mainly due to a shift in the country 's population .\n",
      "S The government has responded to this issue by establishing policies and programs to manage the aging process .\n",
      "S Most of the policies aim to reduce the problems associated with an aging population .\n",
      "S One crucial is problem the increase in government expenditure for the aging population which in turn strains the future working population .\n",
      "S Although some policies do facilitate in reducing the expenditure towards the elderly to a certain extent , it may still prove to be insufficient in easing the aging process .\n",
      "S One segment of policies that the government has implemented is to increase the total fertility rate of Singapore .\n",
      "S These policies aim to produce a higher rate of productive children for the future workforce .\n",
      "S They will be the ones to support the large number of the future aging population .\n",
      "S However , the policies have proven to be ineffective ( Wong & Yeoh , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S For example , the Baby Bonus Scheme which was introduced in April 1 , 2001 , was established to reduce the financial costs of raising children by providing cash grants .\n",
      "S The cash grants can be used to pay for child care , preschool and healthcare expenses .\n",
      "S The scheme caused an adverse effect as it only focuses on the explicit costs .\n",
      "S The government failed to include the implicit costs of raising children .\n",
      "S Some of which includes giving up one 's career to take care of their children .\n",
      "S Therefore , with the progressive economy , many prefer to establish their careers before having children .\n",
      "S The cost of raising children has also risen in the past years due to the need to enroll them in numerous programs .\n",
      "S Parents in this modern society want their children to be equipped with numerous amount of skill to prepare them for the future workforce .\n",
      "S Another policy implemented by the government involves providing for oneself through life-long savings .\n",
      "S This policy is implemented through the Central Provident Fund , CPF scheme .\n",
      "S The CPF scheme is a compulsory savings meant to meet one 's basic living needs upon retirement .\n",
      "S Under the CPF scheme , the Medisave scheme is developed to lessen the impact of medical and hospitalization expenses .\n",
      "S However , the Medisave scheme have proven to be insufficient because medical expenses for the elderly are simply too high that one 's Medisave savings can be used up within one week ( Popatlal , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Moreover , with longer life expectancy , the Medisave savings may not be adequate .\n",
      "S This problem becomes worst if the elderly does not have any children or children who choose to neglect their responsibilities to support their elder 's healthcare finances .\n",
      "S Thus the National Housing policies were introduced to encourage filial responsibilities of the adult children .\n",
      "S However , it has been proven to be unsuccessful .\n",
      "S This may be due to the change in culture and values of the modern adult generation since they prefer to live further from their parents .\n",
      "S On the other hand , housing policies may have an opposite effect as some couples may misuse the policy by using the grant for their own benefit .\n",
      "S One example of a housing policy that has proven to be unsuccessful is the Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme which encourages parents and married children to live together ( Hill and Kwen , 1995 ) .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , some developments that the government has implemented do ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The current development of new community hospitals which links up with the main hospitals is an example of a measure that will ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Community hospitals are built to allow the elderly patients , usually with chronic illnesses , to recover with the assistance of a professional medical team but at a lower cost .\n",
      "S This will reduce medical expenses for the elderly .\n",
      "S In addition to that , community hospitals will free up beds in the main hospitals for acute illnesses .\n",
      "S Easing the aging process by establishing policies that solves explicit problems has proved to be inadequate .\n",
      "S These policies may be useful only as a short-term solution .\n",
      "S The government may need to consider the social changes and needs of the younger population to improve the aging process on a long-term basis .\n",
      "S This may include the impact of the rise in living expenses and the influences of the western culture .\n",
      "S Without considering these social changes , the aging process may increase government expenditure and the burden of the future workforce generation .\n",
      "S Ageing Population has become an unprecedented fast developing phenomenon reining many countries in the 21st century , more prominently in the developed countries .\n",
      "S In face with low birth rate , policy makers are concerned about the social and economic impacts brought about by this phenomenon .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged and effects on the national budget has been identified as one of the pressing issues pertaining to an ageing population .\n",
      "S Despite strains experienced on public spending , to a large extent in my opinion that the well being of the elderly should be attended to first with priority before any other aspects come into considerations during policy making .\n",
      "S Only so can then the other problems arising from an ageing population be resolved simultaneously .\n",
      "S With longer average life expectancies in the ageing population , demand for a good healthcare system to be in place is critical .\n",

      "S Instead governments could undergo reallocation of budget whereby more funds initially set aside for childcare amenities be transferred to fund the development of elderly friendly amenities since the precede needs fewer resources due to low birth rate in the population .\n",

      "S The government should actually help to subsidize the medical bills for the elderly .\n",
      "S For example , in Singapore , the Medifund set aside by the government can help the elderly to subsidise their hospital bills .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in United States , there is the Medicaid programme .\n",
      "S It is directed to the marginal elderly for their stay in hospitals and nursing homes ( Nelson , 1982 , Pg 93 ) .\n",
      "S Around thirteen percent of the total personal health care expenditure run by public programmes comes from Medicaid .\n",
      "S ( Nelson , 1982 , Pg 93 ) .However , the elderly should be responsible for their own health by maintaining a healthy lifestyle first .\n",
      "S They should keep themselves physically fit to prevent serious health implications at a later age in life .\n",
      "S Prevention is better than cure .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , public spending on healthcare subsidy should neither be reduced nor limited as the elderly still deserve the care from the society to lead a prolonged life .\n",
      "S On the contrary , excessive public spending can also hinder the development of a country too .\n",
      "S The continual provision of public assistance for the elderly through public spending can actually drain the resources of the state .\n",

      "S Despite the above said , it may be objected that as the elderly had contributed significantly to the country 's development in their younger days , in view of their long term hard work , they should be entitled with more benefits than the rest of the population .\n",
      "S Governments should also set aside sufficient funds to assist them in coping with their old age life , be it in terms of financial or social assistance .\n",
      "S For instance , as people age , there is an increased need for more healthcare resources , hence leading to an inevitable spending in healthcare arena .\n",
      "S However , for the old-aged with low or no income , they may face difficulties and restrictions in seeking appropriate medical treatment due to financial problems .\n",
      "S It is therefore crucial for governments to extend assistance to the elderly in the form of medical subsidies , allowances , rebates and other kinds of financial aids to ensure that the needs of the elderly are met and protected .\n",

      "S Likewise , most countries are currently tackling the main perplex issue of an increasing ageing population .\n",
      "S Since today 's silver population of 65 years and above is 15 percent and is estimated to grow phenomenally to around 25 percent by the year 2030 ( Centre for Strategic and International Studies , 2009 ) , thus , governments are deeply concerned with the implementation of fiscal and welfare policies that would directly impact the aged .\n",
      "S A component of fiscal policy , public spending , should be limited so that self-reliance can be inculcated into the aged through forced savings and , the economy can function better by shifting monetary inputs to facilitate trade and investments in infrastructure .\n",
      "S Contrary to limiting public spending , critics of human rights have been rampantly advocating that state funding should not be minimized at the expense of growing the economy .\n",
      "S As it is often said that the most valuable resources of a country are its people , so , the particular group of people who had initially shaped the formative years of a country are now well into their aging years where they are valued and appreciated as a result of their hard work and contribution .\n",
      "S The mindset of respecting those who built the country from scratch resonates with feeling indebted to take care of them when old and providing them with the best of health-care .\n",
      "S Thus , in this instance , financing the elderly is an obligation in which public spending should not be cut back just because the aging population is growing at an alarming rate .\n",
      "S Moreover , to a large extent , the government should favour to fund programmes and policies for the elderly so their interests are well looked after for .\n",
      "S Although it has always been the case that an appropriate amount of public spending is set aside for the aged , however , it is more of utmost importance to instill a sense of self-reliance in them , which can be effected through educating about saving for retirement throughout the period in the workforce .\n",
      "S This plan of accumulating savings by an individual is compelled by law in some countries and at the same time , while the savings can help to enhance one 's responsibility for his own life , they can also provide him with financial security after retirement .\n",
      "S In this way , the aged would not be too dependent on family and the state for financial assistance .\n",
      "S Furthermore , when public spending is minimized through self-reliance on the part of individuals to save for their future , the money can instead be put to better use to help those who really need it .\n",
      "S Another point in case is that since the elderly can be self-sufficient to support themselves in old age , public spending in this area is thus limited , and may eventually result in a shift of state funds and capital to boost other sectors of the country 's economy .\n",
      "S As such , there may be a huge concentration of growth in the area of trade because when more capital is used to invest in trade , it reaps substantial rewards in the form of revenue and , higher growth and stability of the economy will ensue .\n",
      "S Besides that , state funds and capital can be used to improve on the infrastructure of the country ; e.g .\n",
      "S public transport systems , telecommunications sector , energy and water resource divisions and etc , so that the country may possibly advance and prosper with the advent of new technologies and infrastructure .\n",
      "S Therefore , when the economic growth is stable , this will lead to avenues of vast opportunities to further develop the country , and also result in fewer elderly in dire needs ( Friedland and Summer , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S As a whole , the notion of public spending can be viewed as akin to a coin which has two sides .\n",

      "S The previous draft work is as attached below\n",
      "S By 2030 , senior citizens will comprise about 19 % of the Singapore population .\n",
      "S As a result of that , the Singapore government has been actively engaged in formulating elderly-friendly policies .\n",
      "S It is important that the needs of the elderly are factored into policy formulation as the demand for welfare benefits and healthcare subsidies will rise as the population ages .\n",
      "S Hence , to prevent the ageing process from becoming a burden on the country , it will require policy treatments to cushion the adverse impact of the demands of an ageing population .\n",
      "S Singapore has made much headway dealing with an ageing population .\n",
      "S Singapore 's HDB has been making our public housing estates more elderly-friendly .\n",
      "S First , HDB has introduced studio apartments with a shorter lease of 30 years .\n",
      "S Elderly homeowners can sell their flats and move into a more affordable studio apartment .\n",
      "S Secondly , it has also introduced a Lease Buyback Scheme .\n",
      "S Under this scheme , HDB will buy back the tail end of the lease on the flat and leave the elderly homeowner with a short lease of 30 years on the same flat .\n",
      "S This means that the elderly can continue to stay in their flat without having to move out .\n",
      "S Additionally , they will receive a lump-sum payout as well as a monthly payment in the form of a lifelong annuity .\n",
      "S The schemes offered by HDB have certainly helped to ensure that the elderly in Singapore can continue to provide for themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S In the area of healthcare , Singapore has maintained a high level of quality and accessibility for every Singaporean .\n",
      "S In addition to granting government subsidies , individuals are also expected to shoulder a portion of their own healthcare costs .\n",
      "S They have put in place the highly effective 3Ms framework - which refers to Medisave , Medishield and Medifund - which is Singapore 's healthcare financing approach .\n",
      "S Over the years , various policy changes have further been made to improve the existing system .\n",
      "S The changes have also included the extension of Medisave to cover more outpatient treatments and the enhancement of Medishield to improve the payout for larger hospital bills .\n",
      "S These healthcare policies will ensure that the elderly will be adequately self-sufficient in their golden years .\n",
      "S Even in the face of success , it is important to periodically review the economic and social impact of housing and healthcare policies .\n",
      "S Our public housing policies will have to adapt and respond to the changing needs and aspirations of Singaporeans .\n",
      "S With the rising standard of living , the housing needs in Singapore will change as well .\n",
      "S Pressures to spend on healthcare will also rise with an ageing population .\n",
      "S Public request for subsidies to cover the latest medical treatments , the improvement of service quality , and the reduction of fees for subsidized specialist consultants are becoming more common .\n",
      "S With such pressures , the need to prevent healthcare costs from escalating remains a key challenge .\n",
      "S All in all , Singapore has been largely successful in accommodating the rising proportion of elderly in its society .\n",
      "S By providing support in the areas of housing and healthcare , the country has prepared well for the ageing process .\n",
      "S \" To a large extent , current research and development or policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S \" I strongly agree with this agreement .\n",
      "S Nowadays , lots of researchers and developments have been carried out and many policies have been implemented in order to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The three main policies that I will be discussing are filial obligation , later retirement and government subsidies .\n",
      "S Firstly , the main problem of aging population is that the children do not want to take care of their parents when they are old , because they think that parents are troubles for them , since they are old and unable to contribute .\n",
      "S One of the methods to resolve this problem may be through legislation .\n",
      "S For example , the Singapore government has implemented the Maintenance of Parents Act since 1996 , and a Tribunal for the Maintenance of Parents has been established .\n",
      "S Under this act , parents who are above age of 60 and are unable to support themselves can claim maintenance from children .\n",
      "S Children who are failed to do so may be fined up to $ 5000 or jailed up to 6 months .\n",
      "S According to the statistics made by a government organization , in the first 3 years that this act was implemented , 400 parents sought for aid under this act .\n",
      "S Some may argue that filial obligation should be by their own will and shall not restricted by law .\n",
      "S But , if the children are still failed to do so after much education , legislation will be a must in solving this problem .\n",
      "S If children are bounded by such filial obligation , they will then take care of their own parents , and hence , the elderly dependency on government subsidies or the public may be reduced .\n",
      "S Secondly , some of the senior citizen who do not have any children will have no support at all .\n",
      "S Thus , it is crucial that they have their own jobs , own income , in order to support themselves .\n",
      "S As a result , later retirement is encouraged by government from many countries .\n",
      "S After retirement , elderly always stay at home and have less activities .\n",
      "S Eventually , they will become weaker , more forgetful , slower in reaction and less agile .\n",
      "S Not only that , the biggest problem is they will have no income to support themselves .\n",
      "S Hence , later retirement will be a good option for them .\n",
      "S The reason is , with a job , the aged can keep themselves busy and do more thinking in order to complete their work .\n",
      "S So , it keeps them healthy .\n",
      "S At the same time , they may have stable income to support themselves .\n",
      "S For example , the Singapore government has extended the retirement age of Singaporeans from 60 to 62 , and at the same time , provides them with trainings and courses , such as the Ling Kwang Home and Seniors @ eCitizen , in order to meet the requirements of the employers .\n",
      "S Some may argue that later retirement is too burdening for elderly , but it is actually optional for them , depending on their own abilities and desire .\n",
      "S In short , later retirement can help the elderly to accumulate more wealth to support themselves , maintain healthy bodies and find new purpose of life so that they are less dependent on the others .\n",
      "S Lastly , it is undeniable that , some of the elderly have no children , and they are unable to work , especially those who are too old or uneducated .\n",
      "S Hence , the government and the public will play an important role in order to curb this problem .\n",
      "S For example , the Singapore government has implemented lots of policies and provided much subsidies to help those elderly .\n",
      "S One of the subsidies will be Home Medical and Home Nursing Subsidy provided by the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) .\n",
      "S MOH targets to fund 50 % of the elderly population requiring home care services .\n",
      "S With the subsidy , the elderly can stay in their own houses as they do not have to stay in hospitals .\n",
      "S As a result , the lonely elderly can also stay healthy in a community .\n",
      "S In a nutshell , there are various problems arose due to the aging population .\n",
      "S However , rather than to discriminate and despise the elderly , we should put in more effort in trying to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The three main methods in solving this problem will be filial obligation , later retirement and government subsidies , Last but not least , every single people and organizations should combine strength together to curb this problem , as quoted in the MOH Philosophy , \" An elderly person should stay in community for as long as possible as institutionalization should only be a measure for the last resort .\n",
      "S \"\n",
      "S The ageing population in Singapore has been growing gradually since the mid 90s .\n",
      "S This increase was deal to the larger number of babies born between the baby boomers ' years of 1954 to 1964 , and the fall in birth rates subsequently .\n",
      "S Moreover the size of the ageing population is expected to increase more by the year 2030 ( by 18.7 % ) , it is therefore be expected that the government spending should likewise increase .\n",
      "S The question is how much should the increase be and should there be a limit put in place ?\n",
      "S These questions proved to be contentious and controversial and I will be further expanding these ideas through this paper .\n",
      "S Considering that a minority of the elderly population are stuck in the poverty cycle and continues to be weak and dependent on the government financially , we also should not however assume that all the elderly are unable to support themselves financially .\n",
      "S Statistics have shown that it is expected that the predominant of the elderly population by year 2030 will be more affluent since they are given better access to education and other opportunities .\n",
      "S Good health and material needs being granted , the elderly population would be expected to be capable of being responsible for their own financial needs .\n",
      "S In this case , there would not be a need to allocate limitless public spending upon the aged .\n",
      "S Minister Mentor Lee mentioned about continued nation building and there being a need for more promotion of local entrepreneurship programmes and education .\n",
      "S He advocates that more of such programmes will help Singaporean feel more \" rooted \" and possess a greater sense of belonging , since they will then have a 'stake ' in this country .\n",
      "S Furthermore he also mentioned that our country needs to find new sectors such as the life science field to invest upon so as to keep the economy competitive .\n",
      "S When more money is being invested in these entrepreneurship programmes , there should be an increase pool of business-savvy talents .\n"

      "S Our economy and the population should be expected to benefit from this increase .\n",
      "S The ageing population in Singapore , also known as the \" silver industry \" will provide a potentially lucrative market of labourers to attract foreign companies and business opportunities .\n",
      "S With the increase of local businesses involving the aged population , there would naturally be new products and services in leisure , retail , asset management , insurance and even healthcare catered to the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S In other words , there will not be a need for a deliberate public welfare to take care of the needs of the aged population .\n",
      "S With reference to MM Lee 's sentiments about venturing into new economic sectors , the money invested serves to seek growth .\n",
      "S However we must also take into consideration to either sustain these new fields or deal with its potential after effects .\n",
      "S Taking an example of the stem cell research centres at Jurong Science Park .\n",
      "S In attracting these foreign lucrative industries , the government build new roads and infrastructures to remain competitive globally .\n",
      "S Singaporeans are equipped with the necessary education and skills to become local sources of labourers for the stem cell research centres .\n",
      "S All these intangible costs would require a bigger share of public spending to sustain growth of the foreign industries investments in the long run .\n",
      "S It would be economically rational to place a limit on public spending on the aged population and subsequently channel the excesses to attract more economic investments for the country in the long run .\n",
      "S There are several other notions which are possible to argue in favour of extending a 'limitless ' public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S The adequate welfare of the local population would definitely enhance the citizen 's quality of life .\n",
      "S By providing limitless welfare to the aged would generally improve the living conditions of some of the less fortunate but that might potentially give room to 'free-riders ' who would exploit the welfare system .\n",
      "S It is not a question to reduce or increase public spending upon the aged population , but it is about keeping a healthy balance in public spending efforts .\n",
      "S In conclusion , I believe that spending on the elderly should be limited because with the increase in an independent group of elderly in the future , and new economic challenges which requires more government spending would arise .\n",
      "S The benefits of investing on education , new economic fields , and infrastructures would benefit the nation economically in the long run .\n",
      "S I would propose that public spending should be allocated based on the relative contributions each sector is able to make to the country 's economic growth .\n",

      "S It is commonly agreed that our society is facing an inclination of growing old .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the proportion of residents aged 65 and above increased from 6.8 % of the resident population in 1998 to 8.7 % in 2008 .\n",
      "S The effect of this aging issue is often being over-emphasized .\n",
      "S In fact , aging population is normally seen in all developing and developed countries due to the explosion of technologies and enhancement in lifestyle .\n",
      "S It shall be handed with wise policy planning but not putting in as much country wealth to take care of the welfare of the elderly as possible .\n",
      "S In other words , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain extent as the money can be distributed to other aspects of development .\n",
      "S As a country is moving forward , the aged population tends to be neglected in terms of welfare .\n",
      "S This is why the topic issue is raised , as a result of not forgetting the elderly that contributed much to all the improvements in their younger ages .\n",
      "S Yes , who are we without them ?\n",
      "S However , in conjunction with the positive feedback of modern technologies , elderly in this era are enjoying a much more comfortable lifestyle comparing to decades ago .\n",
      "S They are better educated , healthier and richer due to the economical and sociological changes .\n",
      "S In this case , they have stronger ability to take care of themselves independently .\n",
      "S We shall not be hauled back by the aging issue which welfare is actually better taken care of than before but just taking care of the group of elderly that is really weak .\n",
      "S Government spending is necessary for the welfare of elderly but the bigger portion of it must be retained for other parts of national development .\n",
      "S On a larger scale , government policy should be made based on the advantage of all but not just the aged community .\n",
      "S Public policy is still needed to be drawn up taking into account of the problems the elderly meet , but not to an unlimited extent that goes for their good at all cost .\n",
      "S It 's inevitable there is still a group of aged people who could n't take care of their own welfare , it 's the responsibility of a caring government to take care of their needs .\n",
      "S As implemented in Singapore , filial obligation is drafted in law , which means that children are compulsory to take care of their parents ' elder life , agreeing to the quote \" It would be agreed that children owe to their parents respect and kindness generally and assistance in case of infirmity or any special need... \" ( Henry Sidgwick 1907 ) .\n",
      "S For the layer of aged population who is still healthy but with lower income , they might have problems in accumulating wealth .\n",
      "S Extending the retirement age is a great way to let them choose whether to work longer or not .\n",
      "S Although government spending is to be cut down , the healthcare of elderly should be done at least for the poor .\n",
      "S Subsidized regular check up and medical fees must be offered to the senior citizens who are not able to pay up the amazing high medical costs .\n",
      "S Money saved by cutting off unnecessary projects due to the exaggerated aging issue can be divided wisely into fields that can either promote the enhancement of the country or improve the life of all .\n",
      "S This covers government expenditure ranging from education , health , information and communication , environment , transport and many more .\n",
      "S For instance , education is the most important part to invest , knowing that new generations will be the future work force and taking over the power and leadership position .\n",
      "S As in Singapore , 743.4 million dollars was spent in 2007/08 to achieve a high literacy rate of 96 % ( among residents aged 15 years and over ) .\n",
      "S Other than that , economy should be injected a greater amount of fund to ensure low redundancy rate and minimize the loss in economic crisis .\n",
      "S Other requirements that can be achieved include a green environment , an integrated transport system and excellent communication coverage .\n",
      "S In short , government expenditure should be spent on the welfare of elderly , especially those who are in need .\n",
      "S However , due to the high independence of senior citizens nowadays , it 's not necessary to provide all-range policy to all of the aged population as there 're still many other aspects that should be taken care of .\n",

      "S Aging is no doubt , one of the most pressing issues that many developed countries are facing today .\n",
      "S Japan and Singapore have been battling the aging society for many years where the birth rates are at depressing levels and better healthcare facilities are available .\n",
      "S Because of this aging process , there is a need for research and development to come out with ideas to counteract it .\n",
      "S Thus , to a large extent , I agree that current research and development is the solution to this aging process .\n",
      "S The process can be eased through economical , social and architectural means .\n",
      "S Firstly , through economical means , elderly people are becoming increasingly part of the working community , working past retirement age .\n",
      "S Singapore for example has a minimum retirement age of 62 years .\n",
      "S Elderly people can continuously upgrade themselves through job retraining to acquire relevant skills required for the job .\n",
      "S There are subsidies from government to employers to send workers aged 40 and above to upgrade their skills .\n",
      "S An example is SDF course fee subsidy of up to 90 % for workers aged above 40 with 'A ' levels and below qualifications .\n",
      "S However , critics may argue that employers may hire younger workers due to their lower wages and higher working efficiency as compared to the older workers .\n",
      "S This is not always the case as companies are less likely to waste time and effort to train the newcomers over a period and may not have the satisfied results at the end of the training .\n",
      "S Instead , they may want to retain the more experienced and skilled older workers to maintain a consistent working standard .\n",
      "S As for wages , people aged above 50 will contribute lesser to their CPF accounts and this includes the employer 's CPF contribution .\n",
      "S This will in turn lighten the cost of employing older workers and the company would prefer to hire the more experienced older workers over the less experienced younger workers .\n",
      "S Thus , economically , elderly people will be able to work longer and be more independent by supporting themselves for their retirement .\n",
      "S Secondly , through social policy , there are increasing entertainment activities to keep the elderly personnel occupied .\n",
      "S To cope with the increasing loneliness in elderly people , there are activities that can bond the elders together and engage them in fun-learning and enriching activities according to their interests .\n",
      "S Take for example , the Wellness Programme in Singapore provides companionship with the other seniors through activities like brisk walking , dancing , gardening or cycling .\n",
      "S However , not all elderly people are willing to participate in such events .\n",
      "S Although there are a lot of activities set up for elderly people , it is optimally up to them to decide whether or not to join the activities .\n",
      "S We can not force but encourage them to take up the relevant activities that may interest them .\n",
      "S They should also make an effort to keep a healthy lifestyle .\n",
      "S Take for example , in China , it is common to see many elderly people practising Taiji in the morning in public parks and dancing along the streets at night .\n",
      "S It is thus important to maintain a healthy , yet entertaining lifestyle especially at an old age .\n",
      "S Last but not least , through architectural means , there are many infrastructure and facilities put in place for the convenience of the elderly .\n",
      "S For the safety of the elderly , ramps and slip resistant footpaths are being set up in residential estates .\n",
      "S An example would be at Macpherson Gardens in Singapore where such features are being put in place , creating an elderly-friendly estate .\n",
      "S The flats built in the past in Singapore were not accessible at every floor as the lifts are built in a way where they stop only at specific levels .\n",
      "S Today , to improve the convenience of the residents , especially the elderly , upgrading works are being carried out at various locations , ensuring that lifts will stop at every level .\n",
      "S All these upgrading works are carried out to ensure that the place is made suitable for the elderly to live in .\n",
      "S In conclusion , as many developed countries are facing a fast aging population , proper research and development have to be carried out in order to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Through economical , social and architectural means , we are thinking ahead for the future and creating an elderly- friendly environment for the elderly people to live in .\n",

      "S Nowadays , our society is highly concern about the impact of aging process on our lives .\n",
      "S In order to be a valid candidate for an explanation of the aging process , the changes proposed by the theory must meet the following criteria : ( 1 ) they will commonly occur in all or most humans ; ( 2 ) as an individual ages , these changes will become more pronounced ; and ( 3 ) the changes will lead to cellular or organ dysfunction that ultimately cause failure of the organ or system ( Steven N. Trautwein ) .\n",
      "S Although aging process has arisen many problems in our lives , current science research and social policies have helped to solve these problems .\n",
      "S As the lifecycle of human beings is irreversible , human life expectancy is heavily depends on the rate of aging .\n",
      "S However , lots of money and efforts have been put in by governments , some companies and scientists worldwide to do the research in aging in order to slow down the aging process and also help to resolve some health problems that are caused by aging .\n",
      "S For example , there are scientists who have created fruit flies that are able to live of their normal life spans and thus have made old human cells behave like youth human cells again .\n",
      "S This research is possible to let us living in a longer time and leading to a healthier life in our old age .\n",
      "S As a result , degenerative diseases of old age such as arthritis , diabetes and hypertension can be solved and thus help to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Back in the old days , human longevity is comparably shorter than today 's .\n",
      "S It is because that the invention of medicine has helped human beings to sustain a longer life .\n",
      "S As we know , human cells tend to become unable to regenerate when we reach our old age and this will lead to the failure of organs such as kidneys , livers and hearts .\n",
      "S The only way to cure these diseases is undergoing transplantation .\n",
      "S As the growing aging population has increased the need of organs , it is hard to get enough needed organs for the transplantation .\n",
      "S In this case , artificial organs can help to bridge the time to transplantation and thus improve the survival of patients while they are waiting for transplantation .\n",
      "S Therefore , we should appreciate the hard work of scientists in the lab and medical center since it has improved our old age lives in many aspects .\n",
      "S Other than the medical breakthroughs , social policies for the elderly are also playing important roles to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S For instance , there are social policies such as introducing advanced insurance scheme that encourages young people start saving more to be financially secure in their old age .\n",
      "S Many countries have made individual retirement fund mandatory and hence successfully increase the number of nations who are able to support themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S Besides , some social welfare programs especially those which help to resolve the aging problems , including provide financially help to needed elderly are under way .\n",
      "S These programs protect those underprivileged elderly from starving for food or homeless .\n",
      "S At the same time , some social societies have organized lots of activities for elderly to enjoy their lives and help them refrain from getting mental illness such as depression as they will feel they are worthless and also some of them may lose their partners .\n",
      "S These activities have provided a place for them to socialize with other , get friends , and do exercise as well .\n",
      "S So , these social policies have brought a happy , healthy , safe and comfortable life to the elderly .\n",
      "S In conclusion , our society should pay high attention to the aging problems and come out with solutions .\n",
      "S We are unable to reverse the time but in average we can live in a healthier lifestyle and longer time compare with our ancestors since current research and policies are practical in solving some of aging problems .\n",
      "S Apart from that , there are also many studies in different aspect such as architecture and psychology that are helpful to the elderly .\n",
      "S As the time passed , everybody will eventually become older and so we should prepare for it from now on .\n"

      "S For the past few years , the issue of aging population has been debated widely across the globe as it took our world by storm .\n",
      "S As our economy develops , the sign of aging population worsen .\n",
      "S Facts of such can be seen in developed countries like Germany and Japan , where the median age of citizen in the country is pushing towards 53 and 54 respectively ( Peterson 2001 ) .\n",
      "S As an older population will directly result in lower productivity and higher social and welfare cost in a nation , many sociologist of today are attending and bringing forth strategies , hoping that the issue of elder dependency will be taken care of without threatening a nation 's economy .\n",
      "S While majority of the solutions were revolving around increasing public spending on the aged , many think that such proposal is not viable and well balanced , as the economic aspect of a country has not been taken into account .\n",
      "S People at this opposing end , on the other hand , believe that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development , indirectly solving the aging matter effectively .\n",
      "S In the midst of such controversy , I personally agree that the problem of elder dependency will be better taken care of if a nation limits its spending on the elderly .\n",
      "S For the first reason of my standpoint , it is believed that the root of the elder dependency problem can only be solved if the country invests in other specific areas that would indirectly relief the situation .\n",
      "S By spending directly on the aged , the government is only trying to deal with the consequences and not the source of the problem .\n",
      "S On the other hand , if the country invests in other specific areas like education , the burden of responsibility in taking care the elderly will literately shift from the government to the younger generation .\n",
      "S This is due to the better inculcation and cultivation of morale values among the youth as a result of better education system , thus increasing their responsibility in taking care of their immediate elderly family members .\n",
      "S A country could also focus its spending on developing its financial economy , as the result of such action would be that the working population would be financially better off to take care their immediate elderly family members , reducing the burden on government spending .\n",
      "S For the second reason of my standpoint , allowing massive public spending on the elderly tends to create a negative impact on the society .\n",
      "S Having the mindset that the government would unconditionally support one who gets old , citizens would most likely abuse the system .\n",
      "S Since there are no future worries financially , the working population would eventually spend all their income on personal items without saving for the future .\n",
      "S This would put on even more pressure on the government financially in terms of funding medical and social expenses of the elderly .\n",
      "S Hence , by limiting public spending on the aged , it serves as a good warning sign to people in the working society .\n",
      "S It reminds people that they have to play a fair part in taking care of their own health and wealth management is necessary to ensure financial security in the long future .\n",
      "S Such approach can be seen in countries like Singapore , where employees have obliged to contribute part of their monthly salary to their Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) Account .\n",
      "S The purpose of such account is to ensure that Singaporeans would have sufficient funds to support their own life when they grow old .\n",
      "S Given my above two reasons , one may argue that the ideology of such approach in dealing with aging population is too long-term oriented .\n",
      "S As such , it is impractical and it lacks of ability to deal with the problem in the short run .\n",
      "S As the benefit of the approach can only be seen in the long run , reducing and limiting the public funding amount immediately will result in shortage of funds to deal with current demand .\n",
      "S This will then result in a sudden vulnerable position , where many elder needy will not get the medical and financial attention that they need .\n",
      "S In my opinion , such an opposing view is incorrect .\n",
      "S By reducing the public funding , the government seeks to be more stringent in their subsidization criteria .\n",
      "S This will ensure that those who really need help will still get the attention needed , while those who can still afford to look after themselves will receive lesser in contrast .\n",
      "S Instead of ignoring those who demand help , this approach simply re-evaluates the subsidizing criteria , enforcing the practice of self responsibility for those who can and asking the public to play a fair share in taking care of themselves or their immediate family members .\n",
      "S All in all , in order to tackle the root of the elder dependency problem , corresponding nation should not focus on dealing with the current tangible problems .\n",
      "S Instead , more attention should be placed on the intangible source .\n",
      "S This will eventually result in a smoothen path in securing the aging process , and lessen the burden of the nation 's economy .\n",

      "S An aging population has caused an increase in public spending and declination in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , owing to a decrease in the people who are highly productive .\n",

      "S Prime Minister of Singapore , Lee Hsien Loong said , \" We are crafting new policies , improving our infrastructure and developing effective programs to enable older citizens to lead full and happy lives .\n",
      "S \" An important policy the government had adopted is \" Supporting Lifelong Employability \" .\n",
      "S According to this strategy , government legislates to require employers to offer re-employment to workers for another three years after their official retirement age , not necessarily in the same job or at the same pay .\n",
      "S Government is going to retrain the older and enhance their skills so that they are ready to contribute themselves .\n",
      "S For example , on July 2007 , C3M and local university , Uni SIM offered courses to senior citizens so as to enable them to earn credits through courses and pursue a degree in future .\n",

      "S They possess valuable experiences to impart and mentor the younger that are more productive and innovative , but lack of experience .\n",
      "S The strategy makes senior citizens keep engage and contribute in working field , more self-reliance in finance , boost the economic development of Singapore , with the combining power between the older and the younger , and thus , slow down the aging process .\n",
      "S Besides , the introduction of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , a mandatory saving scheme , is also a policy carried out by government to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Under the CPF scheme , employees have to pay into their individual employee accounts during working years and the savings can be drawn when a person retire to afford his medical expenses or long- term care .\n",
      "S The policy is quite useful in grappling aging issue from economic view point as it encourages financial planning of the elder during their economically active years and lower the rising social issue such as their burden hinder younger generation 's development in terms of their daily living consumption .\n",
      "S Government can also reduce the incentive allocated to the elderly and the public spending can be used in an economical way in the development of country in other areas .\n",
      "S Maybe from the younger 's perspective , the policy does n't make sense as it not only incurs less payout every month , it is also still long to plan the spending for their old age .\n",
      "S However , it is a worthwhile practice for citizens to plan for their income and expenditure and yet their future .\n",
      "S In addition , the implementation of \" Wellness Program \" and policies to create age-friendly environment also help in buffering the aging process .\n"

      "S However , in my view , I agree with the first opinion .\n",
      "S Therefore , this essay will talk about the support for the first idea .\n",
      "S Firstly , the portion of public funds spent on ageing population issues should be reduced .\n",
      "S By this way , governments could make people who are nearly the age of retirement aware of the necessary of actively working to accumulate more money to support themselves in their later time .\n",
      "S Moreover , children certainly have to look after and take responsibility on their old parents thoughtfully than before because they do not want to see their parents be affected from the decrease in funds for old citizens .\n",
      "S Besides , we can see that the elderly nowadays look healthier and more pleasure than ever before .\n",
      "S This is due to the fact that our services for the population are now improved date by date .\n",
      "S For instance , the quality of life is made better as the improvement in health care and sciences now make us possible to turn down many difficulties for senior citizens .\n",
      "S Retiree probably do not need too much money , the main things they want at their age are satisfaction and a good health to live with their family as well as help their offspring to be more experienced .\n",
      "S Therefore , the decline of the money for the old should not have an bad impact on ageing population .\n",
      "S It is worth remembering that policy makers should also focus on other areas to develop the countries as well as reduce the pressure of the graying population .\n",
      "S For example , an effective solution to the ageing population is increasing the percentage in the governments ' treasuries of other factors such as economy , science , transportation , education and some areas else .\n",
      "S The reason for this way is that those agencies play a significant roles in making the nations go up .\n",
      "S Once the countries are strong enough , certainly the older will be benefited .\n",
      "S To illustrate , spending money on economic researchs help predict the trend of consumption and reduce the bad effects of unstable markets on the whole nations ' economies .\n",
      "S Besides , the improvement in science can not only help the people healthier but also diminish the cost for hospital and medicines .\n",
      "S Moreover , education is surely the most important areas which governments must focus on as well .\n",
      "S The more effectively students are educated , the more productivity and responsible citizens we have .\n",
      "S With the supports from those essential factors , there is no doubt to say that the worry for ageing population no longer exists because authorities have great potential to deal with such problem .\n",
      "S Many critics should disagree to spend less money on the elderly because it is opposite to traditional moral .\n",
      "S Those opponents say that because the number of old households is increasing as the people born in the boomer baby are nearly 65 in 2012 .\n",
      "S Moreover , at present , there are still many children who can not take care for their parents and have to leave them in retire house because those younger people have their own family but they still do not afford to get by in this becoming complex world .\n",
      "S However , in my view , limitation on the public spending for the old does not mean that we do not care about the ageing population .\n",
      "S If we still keep focus on the old , that is a provisional methods , how can we deal with such issue while we are still lack of support from others factor such as science and economy ?\n",
      "S Governments should serve their old citizens in a long run but not in a short time .\n",
      "S Once they make a rich economies and an improvement in science , policy makers can not only emphasize on the graying population but also come out with the solutions to many other problems .\n",
      "S Overall , governments should change their focus on other factors of the country first before they want to help the elderly .\n",
      "S Public spending , therefore , should be used to develop other important areas .\n",
      "S Once those main agencies are strong enough , the solution for the old can be carried out .\n",
      "S The speed of aging process around the world is being hastened due to the high life expectancy and low fertility rate .\n",
      "S Most countries have poured a great deal of resources into this increasing population .\n",
      "S However , if this trend of spending has been continuing in the future time , it will be destructive to a country 's financial structure .\n",
      "S Therefore , spending on the aged should be limited in order to transfer valuable resources to other sectors which also require the country 's attention .\n",
      "S When we flip through the newspapers recently , we usually will read much news which is reporting that countries are battered by the prevalent recession .\n",
      "S The countries in recession are trying by all means to revive their economy now .\n",
      "S According the data calculated by IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) to measure the impact of the financial crisis , the price of financial crisis will indeed be high , like the G20 advanced countries ' GDP will be contracted by 8 % in 2008-09 .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , these costs incurred during the recession will only be about 10 % of the spending related to elders care in the long-term period from now to 2050.Compared to the influence brought by financial crisis , it is critical for a country to divert more resources from the age-related spending to pump up the dire economy .\n",
      "S The substantial cost of generous elderly care will not be fully supported if the countries ' financial position is in a predicament .\n",
      "S Although many rich countries have accepted that it is time to reform their policies , the transformation is progressing only timidly due to reluctance of introducing unpopular measures affected by political factors like election .\n",
      "S Secondly , it is well accepted that a country should have a balanced financial image and appropriate development plans for gaining healthy growth .\n",
      "S The country should not focus much of their effort to explore the incentives for spending in the elderly care , instead , they should set an adequate plan for the sectors which are equally important to the country 's development .\n",

      "S Being a firm believer of 'Prevention is better than cure ' , I agree to a certain extent .\n",
      "S In year 2000 , seven percent of Singapore 's total population is over the age of sixty-five , however , by 2030 this will increase to nineteen percent ( Inter- Ministerial Committee on Aging Report 1999 ) .\n",
      "S Singapore can limit public spending on the aged , using the savings and indirectly alleviate or even reduce the total expenditure catered on the aged in terms of healthcare and accommodation .\n",
      "S By three methods that tackles the problem in a long run .\n",
      "S Firstly , by channeling the money saved to making a more robust educational system , the government can have better civics and moral education .\n",
      "S Starting from a tender age , we should no longer rely on parents to inculcate the youth on what they deem as unimportant issues .\n",
      "S The new comprehensive education system should include firm beliefs that one should take care of their parents when they 're old , instilling a filial piety mind-set .\n",
      "S As more often than not , education can help one out of poverty .\n",
      "S Thus , by having a superb educational system , the government can essentially worry less on meeting the needs of lowly-educated population , tackling the affordability issue .\n",
      "S Secondly , we should encourage family bonding sessions with our elderly parents .\n",
      "S By spending on the development of public amenities like beaches , larger parks , family-oriented shopping malls , etc. , family can get to foster better relationship amongst them .\n",
      "S With better understanding , I believe the child of elderly parents will feel more obliged to compromise their time and money to provide better care and concern for them .\n",
      "S Beaches and parks also provide an avenue for the aged to keep fit and stay healthy , cutting down unnecessary healthcare costs arising when one grows old .\n",
      "S Thirdly , there should be an increase in fund on the healthcare sector .\n",
      "S One primary concern for providing healthcare for the aged is the cost .\n",
      "S Although some might argue that increasing the fund just targets at providing for the aged , by looking at the bigger picture , the improved healthcare system provides for all .\n",
      "S By treating and preventing more problems to arise before one gets old , detecting early symptoms of diseases , etc. , a person can be healthier especially when coupled by good social-policy planning by the government .\n",
      "S It is well known that depression is more destructive than any sickness the aged will have , having a fit mind is essential for having a fit body .\n",
      "S However , as recently mentioned in the media , Singapore will get a boost in fund for palliative care .\n",
      "S The new initiative by the Health Ministry mentioned that the use of Medisave for home palliative care will be liberalised .\n",
      "S This was done in view that the aged actually cherish the quality rather than the quantity of life , similar to the direction of hospice care in providing comfort rather than cure .\n",
      "S The revised funding also will not only include in-patient hospice care , but also to home hospice care .\n",
      "S But despite the revision of spending in this area , they must thread the issue with care as there are doubts over the sustainability over the provision of this free service .\n",
      "S Interestingly , aid for the aged in their psycho-social needs is still lacking .\n"

      "S Besides that , Friedland ( 2005 ) suggests that \" with sufficient economic growth there are more choices and fewer persons in need \" .\n",
      "S Therefore , by diverting the money in the area of economy , we can prevent the elderly to keep depending on the government help .\n",
      "S The second one is in the area of education .\n",
      "S As we know that by the statistic gathered at the year 2008 in Singapore , 68.2 % of the residents who are 55 years and above have only graduated from secondary school .\n",

      "S To the large extent , current researches , developments and policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Medical expenses are most likely to be the burden of aged population .\n",
      "S As human aged , metabolism rate and immunity will start to drop , limbs and body organ such as kidneys , livers , hearts , and other organ will start to fail due to long years of usage .\n",
      "S That is when all the medical expenses start to rise as a result of health problems .\n",
      "S To ensure that the aged population is able to pay large amount of medical expenses which could arise due to their old age , the government has set up a few policies to assist them .\n",
      "S Take for examples , Medisave helps people to save money for their future medical expenses during their younger age , Medishield allows more people to be able buy an affordable insurance since the premium of the Medishield can be deducted from their Medisave accounts , while Central Provident Funds allows people to be less worried about their silver age expenses , include medical expenses .\n",

      "S Although some people might think that the government forces them to contribute part of their income as CPF is against their will , they fail to realize that this 'forcing save ' can be good as it prevent them from squandering it on other less important merchandise .\n",

      "S Other than the expenses , the science and medical discovery is one of most important factor that will help easing the aging process .\n",
      "S Since the risen of consciousness of balance diet , people have been consuming less salt , sugar or high fat food , and , it thus reduced the chances of suffer from chronic diseases like hypertension , diabetes , or cardiovascular diseases .\n",

      "S Besides those , architectural improvement has helped aged people both with and without disability to be able to travel by themselves .\n",
      "S For instances , SMRT company has installed lift at every MRT station and provide bus services that is able to carry wheelchair users .\n",
      "S With those little extra efforts provided by the company , it would be more convenient for those aged people to ride MRT or public bus .\n",
      "S A decade ago , most Singapore HDB apartment lifts are not accessible on every floor , thus it was very inconvenient for older people as they still have to take the stairs which may imposed more danger to them .\n",
      "S Seeing this problem , the government decided to upgrade the lift systems , so we can see most HDB apartment lift is accessible on every floor now .\n",
      "S These cost of architectural improvement required a large amount of fund , but what driven SMRT , SBS Transit and the government to spend so much money on those upgrades even though those upgrades may not affect their profits or themselves much ?\n",
      "S It was because they had seen a future benefits from the upgrades as the improvements will not only benefit aged or disabled people , they will also reduce people travel time thus increase their productivity .\n",

      "S There always have been numerous on-going researches , development or policies to help the easing of the process of aging .\n",
      "S How exactly do we define \" easing of the aging process \" ?\n",
      "S In the simplest terms , it refers to helping the elderly to age with convenience , to age with ease , and to age with grace .\n",
      "S Personally , I agree to a large extent that current research , development or policies in the architecture , economics and medical fields have help to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S There will be three reasons to be elaborated in the following paragraphs .\n",
      "S Firstly , the mobility for the elderly has been improved .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the Building & Construction Authority ( BCA ) has been implementing a \" Barrier- Free \" blueprint known as the Code on Barrier-Free Accessibility in Buildings 1990 ( Building and Construction Authority , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S In this code , they drew up restrictions and regulations which engineers and architects have to comply to make the built environment accessible-friendly for the elderly .\n",
      "S For examples , the authority ensures the installation of lift at every storey of Housing Development Board ( HDB ) flats and Mass Rapid Transportation ( MRT ) stations , as well as building of ramps at all entrances of buildings .\n",
      "S However , people pointed out that the plan is not fully-developed and there are still several shortcomings .\n",
      "S They had commented on one shortcoming that there are still a large number of buildings which are still not full-accessible .\n",
      "S With regards to this , the BCA has already stepped up with the plan by applying another 5-year plan , known as the Barrier-Free Accessibility ( BFA ) Upgrading Program ( 2007-2011 ) to make sure that all buildings will be equipped with barrier-free improvements .\n",
      "S Furthermore , BCA has also set-up a $ 40 million Accessibility Funds for private buildings to be transformed into barrier-free buildings .\n",
      "S Therefore , one can not possibly comment that privatized buildings are not accessible-friendly for the elderly .\n",
      "S In addition , lifts and ramps are currently built at those older MRT stations such as Queenstown MRT station in view of helping the elderly to travel from ground level to ticket gantries easier .\n",
      "S With all these concurrent efforts by BCA , mobility has improved vastly for the elderly .\n",
      "S As such , they can age with more convenience and hence improving their connectivity with others .\n",
      "S Secondly , the Singapore government has employed initiatives to help elderly to extend their working lives .\n",
      "S This is to achieve reduced financial and emotional dependency on the younger generation by the elderly .\n",
      "S This is especially important for any aging population just like Singapore .\n",
      "S The news articles also have been reportedly quoting that the government hopes to reduce the impacts of an aging population by extending working lives .\n",
      "S As such , they came up with initiatives like Skills Program for Upgrading and Resilience ( SPUR ) , for the elderly who wish to work longer .\n",
      "S This program will enable the elderly to upscale their skills so that they can be retained in employability by their employers ( Singapore Workforce Development Agency , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Another initiative is the Lifelong Income For the Elderly under the Central Provident Funds Scheme ( CFP LIFE ) , whereby there is a fixed amount of income for elderly who is aged 65 years old and above .\n",
      "S This will then ensure financial protection for the elderly when they reach the age ( Prime Minister Office , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S On the contrary , people often question the effectiveness of these initiatives .\n",
      "S They may have doubts about is the fund enough to achieve a high percentage of elderly to work longer or can the companies cope with re-employment of older workers ?\n",
      "S With regards to this , the Prime Minister of Singapore , Mr. Lee Hsien Loong had reassured the public that the government will continue to revise the initiatives to make sure that the elderly can work longer with ease .\n",
      "S With regards to the ability of the companies to cope with re-employment of older workers , the government has introduced another program know as the ADVANTAGE !\n",
      "S Scheme ; which offer grants up to $ 400,000 to companies who are interested to re- employ older workers ( NTUC NeXus , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S This is to help them to deal with changes in areas such as wage restructuring and the cost to re-train the older workers .\n",
      "S As such , with these initiatives , the public should be rest assured that the minimum of initiatives will be carried out to guarantee that the elderly can extend their working lives with least problems .\n",
      "S In this way , they can then work to occupy themselves and age with ease that they can at least contribute to the economy .\n",
      "S Thirdly , there are constant medical innovations to slow down the aging process ; such as Botox injections , placenta injections , and skin-lifting .\n",
      "S These medical procedures are being shaped by the media that they can help the elderly ( especially women ) to deal with the physical changes in their body .\n",
      "S This will appeal to people who do not like the signs of aging process to be displayed on their body .\n",
      "S Thus , there are increasing numbers of people who are adapting to these procedures as they rebut that they can age with more grace by doing so .\n",
      "S No doubt on the other hand , people criticized about the negative impacts of such procedures and the attitude of people who engaged such procedures .\n",
      "S They emphasize on the side effects such as the addiction to Botox injections and they often think otherwise for the attitude of this group of elderly .\n",
      "S However , as a matter of fact , any medical procedures will carry a certain factor of risks .\n",
      "S Therefore it is up to the weighing of risk the individual want to take .\n",
      "S Coming to the attitude of the elderly who engaged such procedures which is causing a large debate ; it should be up to the discretion of the individual .\n",
      "S This is actually up to how the individual want to age and their way to deal with the process of aging .\n",
      "S If they feel that they can age with grace and happiness by engaging such procedures , they can do so by all means .\n"

      "S We should only focus on the stand that these medical innovations do help those who want to age in the way which they define themselves in .\n",
      "S In conclusion , current research and development have indeed helped the elderly in their aging process in the ways as mentioned above .\n",
      "S Despite the fact that we do not know the exact measurements of how well these developments have helped the elderly , it is for sure these developments are done to make sure our aging population can be well taken care of .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the most important thing here is that we can see everyone to age with ease , grace and happiness so that there will be lesser aging issues to be addressed .\n",
      "S I agree that to a large extent , current research and development/policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Over the past decade , improvements in the fields of technology and medicine have greatly aided in the aging process .\n",
      "S Further emphasis by governments with regards to public architecture has also made aging easier .\n",
      "S This could not have been timelier , a study done by the United Nations in 2000 states that by 2010 , all developed countries would have an increase in percentage of senior citizens as a whole .\n",
      "S Advancement in technology has made aging much more pleasurable and enjoyable than before .\n",
      "S This can be attributed to greater awareness by technological companies in the needs of an elderly individual , thus attributing greater emphasis in this field of research .\n",
      "S A noteworthy example is Accenture Technology Labs .\n",
      "S All the while , Accenture has been into business research and development .\n",
      "S In recent years however , it has branched out into a video analysis application scans streams from in-home cameras and detects when someone has fallen and automatically notifies kin and emergency services if necessary .\n",
      "S Another good example will be the electronic wheelchair .\n",
      "S Due to the weakening of their legs , many elderly faces mobility issues .\n",
      "S Previously , a person in a wheelchair would require another to push .\n",
      "S This made the user of the wheelchair extremely reliant on an able bodied person .\n",
      "S An electronic wheelchair was not an option as it was too cumbersome and prohibitively expensive .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the battery had very short lifespan and would require constant recharging , which further compounded problems associated with such wheelchairs .\n",
      "S However , over the past decade , improvements in the electronic wheelchair have made it significantly lighter and the battery able to last longer .\n",
      "S With more companies manufacturing such wheelchairs , the cost of a wheelchair has declined sharply , thus making it more affordable .\n",
      "S Evidently , the aging process has been made easier by technological developments .\n",
      "S As the field of medicine rapidly progresses , many illnesses and ailments previously difficult to treat , have now been reduced to mere inconveniences .\n",
      "S The field of medicine can be broken down into two broad categories : drugs and treatment .\n",
      "S In the category of drugs , improvement and discovery of new drugs allow greater management of age-related problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes .\n",
      "S According to the Lancet , a renowned medical journal , new drugs in the market allow patients to control their blood pressure or sugar level without the need for so much dietary restrictions .\n",
      "S On the treatment front , improvements in the pin-hole surgery have greatly minimized the trauma to the patient , leading to shorted recovery time .\n",
      "S An example would be surgery to repair the cartilage in the patient 's knee , which gets worn out due to wear and tear .\n",
      "S According to MIOT hospital , the current pin-hole surgery requires no cutting , thus no bleeding and no need for anesthesia .\n",
      "S The patient can practically be up and running the day after .\n",
      "S With such leaps in the field of medicine , health problems associated with aging no longer is such a big issue as before , allowing people to have greater quality of life in their twilight years .\n",
      "S An often overlooked aspect when it comes to aging is the crucial role the government plays in it .\n",
      "S Social policies , especially with regards to the country 's architecture , implemented by the government will have significant effects on the respective country 's aging population .\n",
      "S More often than not , the construction and maintenance of common walkways fall under the prerogative of the local government .\n",
      "S Hence , in the developed European nations and Singapore alike , the authorities do build walkways which do not have sharp edges which make it difficult for wheelchair users to mount .\n",
      "S Rather , they taper the ends of the walkways into slopes with non-slip coating on them .\n",
      "S This is an example of how social policies with regards to architecture can make life easier for the elderly .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the government has commissioned the building of elderly-friendly public housing .\n",
      "S The flats are equipped with non-slip flooring and many handle bars strategically placed to aid movement within the house , and many other additions which an elderly citizen may require .\n",
      "S To sum it up , social policies that influence architectural designs do play an important role in easing the aging process .\n",
      "S In a nutshell , development and improvement in the field of technology , medicine and architecture have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Expenditure by government , health , education , infrastructure , industrial and socials are examples of government public spending .\n",
      "S Today , government emphasizes more on the aged and spends a high sum of money to assist them .\n",
      "S Quoted from the NHS Community Care Statistics in year 2009 , 1221000 older people are receiving some local authority supported care services which use £ 5.9 billion .\n",
      "S This amount of money can be use for further development .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be reduced so that more spending can be diverted to other sector of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Government should increase education spending in order to nurture people to create a brighter future for the society .\n",
      "S As we all knew , Dr Bill Harrison stated that education is the key to a better future for our children .\n",
      "S Children who are well-educated will have more opportunity in contributing to the society .\n",
      "S Besides that , professionals should be given more incentive to further their studies .\n",
      "S Government should raise the salary for professionals as a way to motivate them .\n",
      "S Having a higher-education qualification can aid the government in education matters such as teaching .\n",
      "S Channel New Asia reported that two thousand more preschool teachers are needed in the next three years to meet the growing needs of the childcare industry in Singapore .\n",
      "S Moreover , retrenching the education cost can initially give the poor some opportunity to have education in rural areas , thus this will definitely benefit to the society .\n",
      "S According to Wikipedia , statistic shows that 19.6 % from the resident non-students aged 15 years and over got no qualification in education of year 2000 .\n",
      "S Furthermore , infrastructure development requires a higher percentage of spending compare to spending on aged because infrastructure plays an important role in ameliorating the standard of living of a country .\n",
      "S Transportation is very important in Singapore because almost all will need to travel .\n",
      "S Singapore transportation consist Mass Rapid Transit ( MRT ) , Singapore Changi Airport and others .\n",
      "S Government should spend more on transportation by providing more facilities for the disable and poor .\n",
      "S Other than that , improvement in waste management is required as pollution is a big issue till today .\n",
      "S More recycle bin or \" Saving the Earth \" event should be carried out by the government .\n",
      "S On the other hand , renewable energy usage such as solar energy , wind energy and water energy should be used more frequently in order to reduce the usage of nonrenewable resources .\n",
      "S For example , wind power generation has a significant share in total electricity generation in Denmark ( around 20 % ) , Spain ( around 11 % ) and Germany ( around 7 % ) .\n",
      "S Hence , government should pay more attention into saving natural resources .\n",
      "S Another significant reason is to concern more on industrialization .\n",
      "S Industrialization can be a core of a country as it is the second widest sector in most country .\n",
      "S Industrial agriculture requires a lot of funds to improve their harvesting and planting .\n"

      "S It is the government 's responsibility to take care of the people 's welfare and support them financially .\n",

      "S This includes elderly homes and activity centres .\n",

      "S Compulsory savings implemented in certain countries such as Britain , Australia and Singapore help ensure that the people have enough savings to meet their retirement needs .\n",
      "S Britain has introduced a compulsory pension scheme in 2006 where the employees have to contribute 4 percent of their monthly pay while their employers have to contribute 3 percent .\n",

      "S These saving schemes in different countries would help ensure that the people have a minimum amount of savings after they have retired .\n",

      "S Sufficient government funding on the aged ensures that the elderly are well taken care of and they have a proper environment to live in .\n",
      "S An article from The Straits Times in 2007 states that the age group above 65 has a \" higher rate of being homeless and poor \" as well as \" desperately sick \" .\n",
      "S It is only socially and morally ethical that we take care of this more vulnerable group of people .\n",
      "S The government should hence allocate enough funds to ensure that all the elderly in the country have a place to stay and proper medical treatment should be made available to them regardless of whether they are able to pay .\n",
      "S However , while this solution reduces the problem of poor and homeless old people , it gives rise to other social problems .\n",
      "S Children of the aged may shirk responsibility and abandon their parents , thinking that the government would take care of their parents .\n",
      "S From a recent article from The Straits Times , some \" Singaporeans were using the recession as an excuse to avoid paying their parents ' nursing home bills \" , even though some looked like they could very well afford it .\n",
      "S In addition , 67 parents sued their children under the Maintenance of Parents Act last year .\n",
      "S If the government continues to fund the old aged , children may think that the government would support their parents financially even if they do not .\n",
      "S This would eventually lead to more children abandoning their elderly parents .\n",
      "S More resources can be diverted to education instead .\n",

      "S Based on an online report by Reuters , there will be 1.3 billion senior citizens around the world by the year 2040.This inevitable growing aged population will only increase problems such as healthcare costs , which could result in slower economic growth for countries .\n",
      "S Therefore , in order to prevent a scenario where a country 's economy is not able to sustain this foreseeable problem , it must be agreed to a certain extent that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S By doing so , there are two main benefits which can help minimize the strain on the country 's economy .\n",
      "S Firstly , with money being diverted to other areas , the country 's overall economy can be boosted .\n",
      "S It is essential that the aged problem should be seen in the long term perspective where the country 's economy is continuously strong enough to cope .\n",
      "S With strategic planning and close monitoring , these areas can both offer the necessary economic growth and also minimize aged related problems being posed .\n",
      "S An example of such an area is biotechnology where it takes advantage of the constant improvement in technology to research and create new products with the use of biological process to improve the quality of living .\n",
      "S Countries like Singapore , recognizing its potential , allowed stem cell research labs to be opened despite its controversy in moral values and religion .\n",
      "S An online article by New York Times suggested the reason Singapore did so was that it hopes in return , such labs will diversify its economy and add on to its research-intensive sector that will improve economy growth .\n",
      "S These labs also manufacture their products locally which can be distributed and used to improve the overall country 's health at a low cost .\n",
      "S Diverting money to such areas prove to provide benefits in both contribution to the economy and aiding in the health where the aged ones are concern .\n",
      "S Secondly , by limiting the public spending on the aged , the healthcare system with regards to the aged problem will thus have to be changed This can be viewed as a benefit as the system will be changed to minimize the effect on the country 's economy and the risk of a failed healthcare system .\n",
      "S To illustrate further , the aging population is growing and it is not feasible for countries to simply continue public spending and varying the amount as needed .\n",
      "S In other words , if a country was to continue with their current system and not consider the foreseeable problem , too much focus and money will be used in an attempt to resolve the aged problem .\n",
      "S By the time it is realized , it could be too late .\n",
      "S Countries are already recognizing this problem ; an example would be the recent dispute in US healthcare system , where the democrats are attempting to cut down on the healthcare system in view of the current recovering and future economy , bearing in mind that the aged population is increasing .\n",
      "S Thus , it is essential that countries start reviewing and emplace new changes where necessary .For instance , one step Singapore has taken is restructuring their healthcare system where elderly patients are treated by acute hospital followed by recuperation in a community hospital .\n",
      "S Hence , a change in the healthcare system will result in cost effectiveness as the aging population increases and efficiency in treatments .\n",
      "S In addition there will be a minimization of a risk of failing healthcare system as there is enough time to make changes and gradually adapt to it .\n",
      "S However , there is a risk involved to limiting spending on the aged .\n",
      "S Many citizens especially the elders of a country will feel that the country is not concerned for their current and future health , therefore losing confidence in the government .\n",
      "S An example used again would be the recent attempt on restructuring the US healthcare system .\n",
      "S Although , the democrats are still at its proposal stage , elders are already starting to express their concerns for their current needs , together with younger citizens worried over their future healthcare .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the aging population is increasing and with it comes slower economic growth for countries .\n",
      "S It is crucial that countries come up with solutions that attempts to deal with this in a long term manner .\n",
      "S Many citizens especially the elderly will be upset over the limited support for the aged .\n",
      "S However , it is also time for these citizens to change their short term perceptions and starting evaluating the possible long term problems if such measures are not being done .\n",

      "S Furthermore , a better transportation link means more money needed to be allocated by the government on this sector .\n",
      "S Well , improvement on the transportation not only helps the elderly , it also encourages the public to use the public transport which reduce pollution as well as traffic jams and older people are wiser in the sense that they are more experienced compare to the na ï ve and impatient younger generation .\n",
      "S It is also not necessary that elderly will claim more money on medical since chronic diseases attack humans without the age barrier .\n",
      "S In the progress of developing mortality in old age , Natural Institute of Aging has done a lot of research to reduce the disabilities and burden suffered by the elderly through studies on the alteration of genes and hormones .\n",
      "S Information from the fields of biochemistry , genetics and physiology has been applied in research to repair tissues and replace injured cells by using stem cells .\n",
      "S Researchers have been furiously expanding their understanding on these pathology changes and identifying the parts of the brain to improve human memory abilities .\n",
      "S At the same time , scientists explore methods to replace dysfunctional cells and develop a protective brain cell into the brain to prevent Alzheimer .\n",
      "S However , these researches do not guarantee that the hormones they produce are useful and it costs a large sum of money to maintain such experiments .\n",
      "S Furthermore , not many people can afford to undergo such gene alter operations .\n",
      "S In spite of that , the government has allocated a large sum of money towards research in the annual budget to encourage new findings on hormones and genetics which could protect aging people in the future .\n",
      "S Subsidies are provided to the elderly to help them with their necessities which indirectly gives them the opportunity to undergo genetic and hormones exchanges .\n",
      "S In conclusion , research and development is the best method to help the elderly survive several conditions that compromise the quality of their health and independence .\n",
      "S Thus , to a large extent , current research and development as well as policies have helped to reduce the effects of aging process in many aspects .\n",

      "S Failure to make decision in government budget will affect whole countries ' systems including economy , education , or environment , etc .\n",
      "S This essay argues that public spending on the aged , one of the most major categories almost governments recently invest in , should be limited for developing other countries ' important areas , promoting their sustainable growths , and forming people 's responsibilities .\n",
      "S First of all , large spending on the aged results in an imbalance of governments ' expenditure .\n",
      "S According to World Midyear Population by Age and Sex of US Census Bureau , the population aged above 60 will rise from 20.38 % in 2009 to 21.97 % in 2020 , which means more governments ' spending on pensions and healthcare .\n",
      "S When the aged public spending has increased as a considerable proportion , the governments find it difficult to keep pace with the advances in technologies , commerce , and education , etc. For instance , a recent Singapore government list in 2008 shows that pensions have been accounted for $ 912 billion that has been equal to 17.8 % in total expense .\n",
      "S And the largest category is health care with $ 925 billion , which was nearly spent on an elder assistance such as home nursing , medical treatment , and long-term care , etc .\n",
      "S In contrast , education , welfare , and environment , which are essential for countries ' development , have only ranked as 3rd , 4th , and 8th categories respectively .\n",
      "S In the same way , Australia has spent nearly 10 % on healthcare while USA has spent about 15 % .\n",
      "S As suggested , \" if the government does nothing it will experience a rise in the structural budget deficit .\n",
      "S This has many problems .\n",
      "S \" ( Pettinger , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S One of the challenges is the increase in the national debt and annual interest payments .\n",
      "S For example , Italy has already borrowed over 100 % of GDP , resulting in a high % of GDP goes on servicing the debt , which will only increase over time .\n",
      "S Secondly , what I want to emphasize is that the governments only limit the public expense , which does not mean that they totally abandon the aged .\n",
      "S There are still activities carried out to help the elder such as providing free travel on public transportation in cities or subsidizing old people 's homes , etc .\n",
      "S Opponents of this position argue that the elder should be paid attention with more and more subsidies because they are the predecessors with a lot of commitment to societies .\n",
      "S However , limiting expenditure on the elder enables countries to invest more in another aspects like economy , education , environment or infrastructure .\n",
      "S Then the countries are stronger and stronger , supporting the aged with large amount of money .\n",
      "S We agree with Chan ( 2009 ) , who concluded : The government has played a strong and pivotal role in developing policies for the aged that both protect the rights of older members in society and , at the same time , reinforce values believed to be important for the society .\n",
      "S Thirdly , less spending on the aged helps decrease the proportion of dependence rate .\n",
      "S In 2009 , 11 % is the percentage of Asia older dependency , which is anticipated to reach 28 % in 2040 .\n",
      "S Similarly , the older dependency ratio of Western Europe is projected to increase by approximately 50 % from 27 % to 53 % .\n",
      "S It goes on to reinstate the elder do count more on the state ; subsequently , more resources must be diverted into caring for them .\n",
      "S Hence , the government should limit the aged subsidies in order to stimulate their responsibilities .\n",
      "S In addition , requiring people to save money in advance can be the incentives for their independence .\n"

      "S \" Aging \" , the fact that human life expectancy is extending longer and longer whilst the fertility rate is reducing gradually , \" is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process that begins with birth and ends with death .\n",
      "S \" Aging populations imply there are pressures stressing on fewer young workers in the workforce who have to support increasing old populations .\n",
      "S Obviously , aging population refers to one of the most difficult challenges that policy makers worldwide are facing currently - how to fund for the elderly in the society .\n",
      "S Although contradict opinions related to this topic , more and more people agree upon the point that public spending on the aged should be limited based on arguments that other areas such as education need more public financial resources , other social security welfare systems have proven to achieve reasonable successes and old people still can possess independent lifestyles .\n",
      "S Detractors usually dispute that old generations should be given rights to claim for public spending provided the contribution they have devoted to the public development .\n",
      "S However , many studies have shown the opposite direction .\n",
      "S A study undertaken in Spain ( 2000 ) claimed that the rising allocation from limited public budget on the elderly is expected to threaten commitments to other deserving groups , especial children .\n",
      "S To add more warning signals , a study done in the U.S. ( 2004 ) indicated that \" spending gap between children and elders increased by twenty percent despite the fact the U.S. poverty rates among children have consistently exceeded those for the elderly , and that in absolute numbers , three times as many children live in poverty , compared to elders \" .\n",
      "S It is no doubt that future prosperity is likely to be negatively affected because the lack of investment in education , nutrition and other aspects for young generations .\n",
      "S In addition , the young workforce is doubly worse off through the pre-determined obligation to support the old generations using their own earnings .\n",
      "S As a result , national aggregate surplus is offset by the public expenditures on the elderly , which leads to the overall effect of reducing potential growth rate and burdening developments .\n",
      "S In other words , the final result would be harmful impacts on overall social welfare rather than contributions as being claimed .\n",
      "S In order to avoid the risky consequences of fully-funded social security system foregoing , some countries opt to go with another manner , including Pay-as-you-go system .\n",
      "S Singapore government is among one of the authorities implementing the system via their Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) Scheme .\n",
      "S CPF requires employees to save for their retirement years whilst they are still working .\n",
      "S Social responsibility stands in the fact that employers also contribute to their employees ' saving accounts at the rate of 14.5 % .\n",
      "S However , detractors usually argue that the effect of inflation rate increases costs of living steadily over the time ; as a result , old generations who retired in the 80s or 90s are likely to suffer in the current situation where prices are highly inflated .\n",
      "S Therefore , a co-residence model which appears to be a complement factor helps to reduce stresses on public funds .\n",
      "S It works with the logic of letting children take care of their own parents , which considerably effective under Asian cultures and contexts .\n",
      "S Thus , there is no denying the fact that the good performance in Singapore herself is a convincing illustration for limiting public expenses on the elderly and investing in other fields such as education and research .\n",
      "S Adding more strength to ideas of restricting funds for the old generations , many people point out that the word \" old \" does not link to disability , institutionalization .\n",
      "S Recent researches have shown that only four or five percent of our older friends or relatives are institutionalized at any one time .\n",
      "S In other words , majority of old populations can live independently .\n",
      "S Moreover , they are capable of obtaining a healthy lifestyle via doing exercises and maintaining proper nutrition plan .\n",
      "S For examples , in 2008 , the Stanford University Medical center team found that elderly joggers are less likely to be killed by diseases like cancer , neurological diseases and infections .\n",
      "S It is to re-confirm that regular exercises provide the elderly with mobile and independent lives , stronger hearts and fewer healthcares required .\n",
      "S Ultimately , it is important to consider specific needs of the elderly rather than distributing funds in general without careful allocation .\n",
      "S By doing that , the remaining public fund would be used more efficiently and effectively in other investment and reinforcement activities and the country would be benefited subsequently .\n",
      "S According the US Census Bureau , the number of people 65 and older hit about 506 million as a midyear 2008 , and this will be double to 1.3 billion by 2040 .\n",
      "S Clearly , aging process will become more and more difficult to deal with and there is an urgent need to tackle this issue .\n",
      "S Solutions should be discussed internationally to gain sharing benefits .\n",
      "S However , specific adjustments need to be made to specific country .\n",
      "S Besides , notwithstanding the agreement upon restrictions on public expenditures on old populations , governments still have to provide necessary supports .\n",
      "S Meanwhile , there must be a reasonable investment on younger generations and a push in national income over the time to balance different benefits of various human groups in the society .\n",

      "S In Singapore today , our median age is 36 years and life expectancy is 80 years .\n",
      "S This number has significantly increased from 24 years since 1980 , and predicted to reach 54 years within the next 40 years , similar to that of Japan and Italy now .\n",
      "S ( Singapore Department of Statistics , 1999 , Lee , 2009 ) There will be increased burden for the working adult population to provide for the aged dependents , be it healthcare or finances .\n",
      "S This is made worse with the shrinking workforce that we are now experiencing .\n",
      "S However , current research and developments , and polices have effectively help eased the aging process .\n",
      "S This is done through technological advances in medical care , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , and adopting a foreign talent policy .\n",
      "S Firstly , recent research and developments have resulted in higher levels of medical care .\n",
      "S For example , new and better treatment methods like open heart surgery or radiotherapy help increase the chances of recovery and decrease time required for recovery from illnesses .\n",
      "S New vaccines and immunizations site are constantly developed to help prevent diseases at an early stage too .\n",
      "S In 2008 , a team of researchers from Wayne State University successfully developed a breast cancer vaccine that is able to treat women with treatment-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer , and prevent cancer from occurring again .\n",
      "S ( Evans , 2008 ) This creates two benefits pertaining to aging population .\n",
      "S One , the population will be generally healthier , with a smaller tendency to fall sick , which otherwise disrupts productivity of the economy and increases the need for medical services and facilities .\n",
      "S Next , by reducing the recovery period for illnesses , people who are ill , especially the elderly population who are more prone to sickness , will require less treatment sessions or usage of hospital facilities and thus incur less medical expenses too .\n",
      "S One may argue that the latest medical treatment methods tend to be very costly and the average elderly in Singapore may not be able to afford them .\n",
      "S This problem is solved with the use of subsides for elderly by the government , to keep medical fees for these new treatment methods within an affordable range .\n",
      "S This would also be just considered as a short term measure , taking into account future medical advances .\n",
      "S More cost efficient methods for the same treatment would be developed which lower treatment costs to a point where only minimal subsides is required .\n",
      "S Secondly , policies to encourage financial independency among the elderly , for instance CPF ( Central Provident Fund ) , Medishield and the extended retirement age from 60 to 62 years in 1999 .\n",
      "S ( Ministry of Manpower , 2006 ) By increasing the retirement age , it creates a motivating effect on people to work till at later age , so as to enjoy benefits like pensions and government incentives after retirement .\n",
      "S They would also be able to obtain more wealth which they could use to support themselves in old age .\n",
      "S This helps lessen the government 's burden to provide for the elderly , and the effects of a shrinking workforce brought by aging population .\n",
      "S Companies would also be able to benefit more from the experience and expertise of their more elder employees .\n",
      "S In addition , elderly workers tend to have lower turnover rates for employment , which is beneficial to the company .\n",
      "S For example Wal-mart , the world 's largest public corporation by revenue , actively hires elderly workers for her operations -- close to 20 % of Wal- mart 's workforce is at least 55 years old .\n",
      "S ( Walter , 2006 ) One may argue that this in a sense forces later retirement , especially for people with insufficient savings to depend on without a job .\n",
      "S However it also emphasizes a greater need to be financially independent and help create more elderly involvement in the society which contributes to the economy .\n",
      "S Thirdly , foreign talent policy , of which the government embraces , also played an important role in easing the aging process .\n",
      "S Foreign talents help increase the workforce in the economy , which helps to solve the problem of shrinking workforce brought about by aging population .\n",
      "S Effective use of their expertise also helps create a more productive economy and generate more economic income which could be diverted to helping the elderly population .\n",
      "S More importantly , they create greater diversity and especially vibrancy in the country , of which lack of it is evidently seen in some countries in Europe due to a decreasing proportion of youths brought about by aging population .\n",
      "S A recent study also indicated a 170 percentage increase in Singapore 's non-resident workforce over the last decade , from 248,000 in 1990 to 670,000 in 2006 .\n",
      "S ( Yeoh , 2007 ) One of the most common arguments against the policy would be that the increased competitiveness of employment which results in loss of jobs for the local population , even with the implementation of foreign employment quota ratios by the government .\n",
      "S However , from a different viewpoint , the increased competition results in greater competitiveness of our firms not only within Singapore 's economy but globally as well .\n",
      "S This policy would also be vital for Singapore to sustain strong economic growth and competitiveness in the global market in the future .\n",
      "S All in all , current research and development , and policies have been successful in easing the aging process , through advancements in healthcare , encouraging financial interdependency and embracing foreign talent .\n",
      "S In the years to come , we will face greater challenges as we gradually experience the full impact of the aging population , of which new strategies will have to be integrated along with the current ones to meet the changing circumstances that we might face .\n",

      "S First of all , does the aged as a real \" social problem \" ?\n",
      "S It is clear that the concepts considering the aged as \" social problem \" are frequently based on \" people 's attitudes , perceptions , and assumptions than on actual facts \" .\n",
      "S ( Egdar , 1997 , page 10 ) .\n",
      "S The aged will not be viewed as a \" social problem \" once it is believed that most the aged are dependent on their survival .\n",
      "S However , as in the recession period , old people got difficulty in supporting for their own living expense , which results in social spending for the aged .\n",
      "S Thus , people often claim that age dependency has become an actual crisis of the society , and government has taken action on attempt to decrease their social welfare expenditures during period of fiscal constraint .\n",
      "S According to \" A graying world \" ( Peterson , 2001 , para 3 .\n",
      "S ) , there are basic strategies , which policy makers and government can consider implementing to lessen the burdensome of older generations to the younger .\n",
      "S These strategies prove that instead of spending much money on supporting the aged , government can seek for another alternatives to reduce the burden .\n",
      "S The most considerable strategy is that stressing filial obligation and increasing the willingness of tomorrow 's grown children to support their own elderly parents through informal and family channels .\n",
      "S ( Peterson , 2001 , para .\n",
      "S 7 ) Originated from Asian cultures , family obligation is the most precious thing , which characterizes the parents-children relationship .\n",
      "S Parents have brought their children up , and in return the children will have the responsibilities to take care of parents when they get old .\n",
      "S It continues for the next generation , who are their little kids .\n",
      "S It is the culture of family-oriented and gratitude for their parents ' giving birth and a settled position to them .\n",
      "S Filial responsibilities might be understood in many ways , such as obligation to help elderly parents , or to keep in close contact with them , or to live near them , etc .\n",
      "S Societies in which the extended family is weak and high long-term care costs such as the United States should learn from Asian countries , where most elderly people still live with their adult children .\n",
      "S Diverting money to other areas of the country 's development does not mean government will take less responsibility to this social problem .\n",
      "S In contrast , it should be thought as one way to help reduce the burden of aging population .\n",
      "S By investing to other areas such as technology , economics , service , health care , etc. society can developed dramatically , which is in return , contributing back to lessen the burdensome of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Hence , elder dependency could be reduced when the elder can support themselves for their own daily expense .\n",
      "S For instance , in Singapore , young working people who are dynamic , active , creative can take a role as main contributors to the country 's budget , while the elder can work in food court or any service jobs .\n",
      "S That is a good classification of working labors in the society that take good advantage of the scarce labor force .\n",
      "S Moreover , by doing so , the elder can earn for their living , have a savings for future need on health care , and have less dependency on their younger generation .\n",
      "S In conclusion , this essay shows a favorable view of social spending on the aged should be limited , and money can be diverted to other areas of the development of the country .\n",
      "S Although it is a controversial issue to talk about aging population and its burden to the society , this essay indicates alternatives government can do besides spending too much on the aged to adapt to the challenge for the future , which is \" to ensure that people everywhere will be enabled to age with security and dignity and continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights \" .\n",

      "S Fortunately , much can be done as current research and development/policies have shown hope of easing the aging process by dealing with the consequences directly instead of the sources .\n",
      "S One of the problems arising from an aging population is the increase in elderly dependency ratio .\n",
      "S The growth of elderly dependency ratio signifies a state where an escalating numbers of beneficiaries of health and pension funds are sustained by relatively smaller number of contributors ( United Nation , 2002 ) .\n",

      "S Shrinking workforce is another problem arising from an aging population .\n",
      "S The manpower resources of many developed countries are predicted to shrink as a hefty portion of the workforce is edging towards retirement .\n",

      "S Therefore , providing opportunities for prolonged working age can essentially alleviate labor shortages and help bolster personal retirement savings .\n",
      "S However , older workers are usually less productive than imported foreign talents whereas employers may compromise on a small portion of existing aged employees .\n",
      "S If employers have the flexibility to hire older employees on a part-time basis , to vary responsibilities as the capabilities of older workers change , they will be much less reluctant to hire and retain older workers .\n",

      "S Aging process in this changing world could have resulted significantly in politic and society with respect to acute financial problem .\n",
      "S In order to ease the current predicament , governments have to emphasize on distribution of their budgets and either modify ways or reallocate funds to reduce the cost of public spending .\n",
      "S This will compel agencies to change the way they service , especially to the elderly .\n",
      "S On the other hand , it is plausible to reward families for having children and enable more young people to work .\n",
      "S The drastic rise in numbers among the elderly will force policymakers and governments to anticipate the resultant demand for healthcare and a host of related infrastructural needs .\n",
      "S The future elderly will be more professional and better educated than current cohorts in many countries .\n",
      "S It means that they are likely to be more effective and decisive in possessing their gains and evaluating on costly or sophisticated services .\n",

      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas such like education which is far more important than the aging issue in todays world .\n",

      "S Indeed no country can move forward without the education .\n",
      "S Due to the aging population there is a shrinking workforce , so government should spend more on education so that it will increase the productivity of the workforce .\n",
      "S So governments should review their budgets according to the spending on education .\n",
      "S Spending on education will give better return to a country in near future because education is a major factor for the country 's economic growth whereas the spending on aged is just the opposite which is spending on the aged is inversely proportional to economic growth .\n",

      "S For a country money should be diverted to other areas like defense , improving infrastructure and thus public spending should be limited on the aged in order to get better returns and to excel in the world .\n",
      "S Most probably for a country opportunity cost for spending in defense and infrastructure is more than the spending on the aged ones because spending in infrastructure generates revenue for a country like attracting foreign investments and tourisms , spending on defense give 's a sense of security to a nation whereas spending on aged is just an expenditure for a country , and for a country to pay its expenditures it should have sufficient amount of revenues .\n",

      "S Though spending on the aged ones could also improves the living standard and the image of a country but would be less effective as compare to the spending in infrastructure and defense .\n",
      "S It is less effective because benefits do not exceed the cost .\n",
      "S So therefore spending on aged ones should be limited so that money can be spend to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Though for a country 's development there should be spending on education , infrastructure , defense , but it is essential for a country 's development that there should be more spending on the aged .\n",
      "S Since from past several decades there is been an increase in the expectancy rate which had probably caused the aging problem , so there should be a sufficient increase in the spending on the aged which will eventually improve the living standard of the aged population and thus will contribute to the country 's development .\n",
      "S There should be an increase in the public spending on the aged because of persistent increase in the inflation rate through out the past several years .\n",
      "S The spending on the limited should not be limited or fixed but should be proportional to the increase in the inflation and life expectancy rate .\n",
      "S On the other side the increase in public spending may cause self-dependency , which is that the aged population will than totally rely on the workforce and the governments for their needs and thus would be exploiting the economy rather than contributing in it .\n",
      "S Overall it depends on the country 's situation and the budget that whether they should limit their spending on aged or not .\n",
      "S For a country 's development , it has to overcome with these crucial challenges of aging population , and for this an appropriate strategy would be needed which is to spend more on education , infrastructure which will generate sufficient revenue in near future and thereafter it can spend on the aged .\n",
      "S There should be limited spending on the aged so by that the aged population will work to fulfill their needs which will increase the workforce of the country and so by limited spending the aged will contribute for the country 's development .\n",

      "S Now , the Singapore government is trying to raising the population growth by giving out incentives through Children Development Account ( CDA ) and building cheap and easily accessible child care centre for working parents .\n",
      "S But since the living cost in Singapore has been so high that it is even called as the 10th most expensive city ( Hoe , 2009 ) , government may consider increasing incentives to increase the population of new generation therefore , increasing the total number of work force and reducing the percentage of total aging population .\n",
      "S In the future it may also reduce the number of single elderly that in turn will provide them family that will take care of them .\n",
      "S In this part , education is also important as it shape future leaders for the nation itself .\n",
      "S Increasing education quality also means increasing quality of future 's work force that should boost the nation in every sector .\n",
      "S Education also plays a large role in shaping the students ' character and moral to prevent them from neglecting their elderly parents when they become adults .\n",
      "S A good academic and moral education should probably increase the quality of Singaporeans both in terms of working capabilities and also filial piety .\n",
      "S Providing a qualified and affordable education should also be in government consideration on allocating budgets .\n",
      "S Another may argue that indirect support for the elderly is not sufficient in this time when aging population in Singapore is predicted to increase from 235,000 in 1999 to 796,000 in 2030 ( Chan , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S However , it is not absolutely true as there is CPF policy that government create to make the elderly support themselves .\n",
      "S The concept is that when they are still in working age , some of their income will be put into savings .\n",
      "S The institution which they work at will also provide a percentage of funds to the savings .\n",
      "S Experts agree that CPF is effective in providing aging population support for their old age as CPF also has been strategically segmented for health insurance and retirement funds that one study even remarked CPF as changing the concept of social security from providing savings for retirement to providing savings for life ( Choon and Low , 1996 ) .\n",
      "S Welfare cost for the aged will increase indefinitely as the aging population keep increasing , so without limiting the public spending for the aged , it may eventually take much larger portion of the national budget .\n"

      "S Not only that , the elderly people acquire the essential skills , knowledge and experience in their respective work fields so if they continue working , they will be able to impart their skills to the new working generation and share their valuable experience with them so that they will not follow the mistake that the senior have made during their working lives .\n",

      "S This is not true as now countries like Japan and US are encouraging elderly entrepreneurs that will eventually create more jobs for them .\n",
      "S The aging of Singapore population was also due to the fertility decline in the beginning of 1970s whereby the government had come out with policies to discourage people from having more children .\n",
      "S This campaign proved to be so successful that resulted a 0 % growth in population by 1986 .\n",
      "S However , the government soon realized that the Singapore population was not reproducing itself so it reversed its population planning policy by introducing the \" Baby Scheme \" to encourage more birth rate .\n",

      "S This serves as a benefit for couples to lessen their financial cost for raising children .\n",
      "S As financial cost of raising children is one of the important factor for couple to decide whether they want to have children or not , and by lighten it will thus increase birth rate .\n",

      "S Taking the Central Provident Fund Scheme ( CPF ) for example , this scheme is only applicable and beneficial to the sector of people who had , or are having employment .\n",
      "S ( Ministry of Manpower [ MOM ] , 2007 ) The CPF scheme is broken down into three portions , namely ordinary account , special account and Medisave account .\n",
      "S ( MOM , 2007 ) Thus , people who did not have employment will not have any monies that are meant for their retirement and healthcare .\n",
      "S Also , the Parents Maintenance Act is only relevant to the elders who have children .\n",
      "S ( Attorney-General 's Chamber of Singapore [ ACG ] , 1996 ) As a result , those without children will then fall outside this umbrella of asylum .\n",
      "S On the other hand , critics might argue that policies are never able to shield the entire spectrum of its target audience .\n",
      "S However , it must be noted that new policies must then be formulated to benefit those who are less fortunate .\n",
      "S For example , the Government could top-up the Medisave accounts of the less fortunate elder Singaporeans when there are budgetary surpluses to ensure that seniors have the capacity to afford healthcare services .\n",

      "S In addition to being limited , the current government policies are ineffective in soothing the ageing process .\n",

      "S In addition , the Government 's plan to ensure that all public spaces in housing estates such as parks and sporting venues have facilities that cater to the whole family including seniors ( MYCS , 2001 ) is not practical because it has not considered the fact that the average elder in Singapore is either not interested in sports or are unable to play sports due to chronic ailments .\n",

      "S ( Suriah , Chong , Yeoh , 2008 ) .\n",

      "S The reason why Americans classify \" oldness \" to be above 65 years old is due to the fact that they strongly believe that they still can contribute to society after retirement and thus they continue to embark on meaningful roles .\n",

      "S In conclusion , through the various available health polices , government policies , social policies and technological advancements , the elderly now is able to lead a better more comfortable and more fulfilling life .\n",
      "S Despite the systems and policies being imperfect , it has definitely brought about benefits to both the aged and general public as a whole .\n",

      "S In the years to come , more and more countries will be facing problems aroused from aging process .\n",
      "S Hence solutions are very important and this passage will evaluate on the current measures imposed on aging process by various countries .\n",
      "S Firstly , elderly employment is a policy that was implement by some countries .\n",
      "S Steen Langebaek , president of AGE , an organization which aims to promote the interest of older people across Europe , believes that older people should be encouraged to study and work beyond retirement , whether through part-time work or on a voluntary basis .\n",
      "S ( S. Toyne , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S It means elderly are welcome to continue serving in the workforce provided they are willing themselves .\n",
      "S This may eventually benefit both the individual and the company ; elderly receive additional income from their work , whereas companies gain from the work produced by the experienced elderly .\n",
      "S Hence older people are an enormous neglected resource that should not be forgotten , they should play an active role in society .\n",
      "S In Europe countries , work organization and social security arrangement are flexible in providing options for combined work with retirement .\n",
      "S The combination of the two factors created more vacancy and elderly who volunteer to work .\n",
      "S Therefore , this measure had been very successful , especially in Netherlands with 49 % of elderly either working full or part time .\n",
      "S ( G. Schmid , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Also , Silver job fairs , established to find jobs for people 60 and older , have mushroomed across South Korea in the past year as part of a government effort to assist a rapidly growing population of older Koreans adrift in a changing society .\n",
      "S ( S. H. Lee , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S From the above examples in different continents , it is inevitable to conclude that elderly employment is one of the policies that have been well adopted by various governments .\n",
      "S Secondly , science and technology have eased aging in various ways .\n",
      "S Japan had started to develop robots meant for elderly .\n",
      "S \" With Japan 's aging population , we need robots that can alleviate the burden of human tasks , \" says Toshihiko Morita , director of Fujitsu 's Autonomous System Laboratory .\n",
      "S ( D. Behreandt , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S This \" mental commitment robot \" is designed to provide comfort and companionship to elderly who are lonely or shut in .\n",
      "S With the introduction of robots , elderly have a better protection as well as reliance .\n",
      "S It is especially true for the single elderly who do not have any children to take care of them at home .\n",
      "S In addition , drugs have also been developed to slow aging .\n",
      "S Currently , the drug that helps to reduce aging is being tested and will be releasing into the market soon .\n",
      "S \" It may be the ultimate free lunch how to reap all the advantages of a calorically restricted diet , including freedom from disease and an extended healthy life span , without eating one fewer calorie .\n",
      "S Just take a drug that tricks the body into thinking it 's on such a diet .\n",
      "S \" ( N. Wade , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This useful drug will ultimately increase life span , hence increasing the productive of the workforce as people could retire at an older age because of this drug .\n",
      "S Thirdly , governments from various countries have provided retirement pension , medical scheme and policies to cure the aging population .\n",
      "S Singapore has implemented the retirement pension scheme Central Provident Fund that allow elderly to fund for their retirement right from the start of their working life .\n",
      "S This policy has been effective as the compulsory contribution to the fund will be allocated to both medical account and general account , which does not only ensure financial but also healthcare stability .\n",
      "S Government could also save the budget on state pension at the same time .\n",
      "S In addition , the Housing Development Board of Singapore introduced studio apartments that were catered for the elderly .\n",
      "S The forty square meter apartments include facilities like lifts on every floor , hand railings and alarm systems that were specially designed for elderly .\n",
      "S Government has also promised to build more studio apartments in the upcoming projects .\n"

      "S As Thomas Jefferson , the 3rd president of the United States , once said , \" Never spend your money before you have earned it .\n",
      "S \" This quotation is particularly applicable in China 's context .\n",
      "S Public expenditure in China should be limited and diverted to other areas due to its negative impacts on the country 's economic growth , the living standard of the younger generation and other sectors of the economy .\n",
      "S Excessive government expenditure on the aged will impede the economic growth of China .\n",
      "S China 's public expenditure for public health is rising at a high pace .\n",
      "S According to the National Bureau of Statistics ( 2006 ) , the spending for public health has been increasing at about 10 % annually from 2000 to 2006 .\n",
      "S This is faster than the economic growth rate of China , which is about 8 % ( NBSC , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Large portion of the public health expenditure actually goes to the aged .\n",
      "S The expenditure on elderly people is slowing down the economic growth .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the negative impacts of these policies will be more significant in China as its economic base is not so strong compare to developed countries such as the U.S and Japan .\n",
      "S Those who oppose cutting government expenditure on elderly argued that limited spending will cause social instability as many families with low income will suffer when the elderly generation needs medical support .\n",
      "S However , economic growth affects the nation 's long-term well-being .\n",
      "S The money should be used more wisely .\n",
      "S For instance , Japan 's economy situation shows us the consequences of abusing of government budget on public health spending .\n",
      "S Japan is well known by its ageing problems with 22.1 % of the populations above 65 ( Minister of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S The Japanese government has to spend a lot on the public health .\n",
      "S As a result , Japan has experienced a slow economic growth over the last 20 years .\n",
      "S Therefore , for China , being a country which is much less developed than Japan , to limit the spending on the aged will be a more wise decision .\n",
      "S It will be burdensome to China 's next generation , especially the tax payers , if the expenditures on medical and welfare programs are not held in check .\n",
      "S The extra burden of the medical and welfare programs expenses falls on the next generation .\n",
      "S The tax payers have to finance the medical expenses of their own parents and at the same time , pay for other elderly people 's medical bills .\n",
      "S The negative impacts will be even worse in China due to its one-child policy since 1970s .\n",
      "S In the near future , a couple has to support four parents .\n",
      "S If the government raises tax to finance the expenses on aged , the younger generation would even face difficulties making a living .\n",
      "S Some sociologists argued that if the expenditure on public health is to be limited , the younger generation has to pay more .\n",
      "S The expenditure just shifts from public expenditure to private expenditure .\n",
      "S While it may sound true , someone in the society have to sacrifice in order to solve the current ageing problem .\n",
      "S If we continue increasing this expenditure and ignore the negative impact it has on the economy , Japan 's present will be China 's future .\n",
      "S Thus , it is reasonable for the Chinese government to limit the spending on the aged in order to improve the long-term well being of its citizens .\n",
      "S Last but not least , China 's public spending should be limited because there are other sectors of the China 's economy which need the money more imperatively .\n",
      "S China is still a developing country today and more of the government budget should go to the sectors which are able to generate more wealth .\n",
      "S In 2008 , the total expenditure for public wealth in China is RMB 984 billion , which is about 3.3 % of the total GDP ( Ministry of Finance of China , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S A portion of the money should be diverted into the sectors which are more important in the long run such as education and R&D .\n",
      "S According to the National Bureau of Statistics , the expenditure of the government on education last year was RMB 901 billion and on R&D was even lower , RMB 213 billion ( Ministry of Finance of China , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S China has to be fully industrialized first before spend its money on the old .\n",
      "S Otherwise the problem will be accumulated .\n",
      "S Hence , a restriction of the expenditure on the elderly people should be implemented .\n",
      "S In summary , it is unwise for the government and policy makers to solve the aging problems in China by simply increasing public expenditure on the old .\n",
      "S Long-term effects of these policies must be carefully taken into account and the government should be more concerned about how to sustain the economic growth in the long run .\n",
      "S In conclusion , less of China 's wealth should be spent on the aged so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",

      "S Nowadays , with the rapid change in technology , the current skills sets that the elderly possess are mostly obsolete .\n",
      "S Hence , skills upgrade and training program like those offered by Workforce Development Agency should reach out to more elderly and make it easier for them to upgrade themselves to reduce their barriers to entry into the workforce .\n",
      "S With the elderly returning to the workforce they will be able to accumulate more wealth and save more so that they will be able to be self sufficient when they are older .\n",
      "S Besides , returning to the workforce means that they will continue to contribute taxes , thus helping to reduce the burden on the society .\n",
      "S As they continue to work , they will maintain their Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) account which acts as a social security savings plan for them in the future .\n",
      "S The CPF account prevents the elderly from depleting their savings and allows them to be financially independent even when they finally stop working .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is essential to provide skills upgrades for the elderly and by doing so it will reduce their barriers to entry so that they can continue to work and reduce the impact of aging on the economy .\n",
      "S The government are aware of the challenges faced by the aging population due to inadequate facilities and living conditions and have influenced the change in the environment so as to make life easier for the elderly .\n",

      "S To quote an example , just 10 years ago , cataract surgery required a hospital stay of several days .\n",
      "S Now , the surgery can sometimes be done in less than 30 minutes on an outpatient basis .\n",

      "S These result in a decline of the proportion of economically productive people .\n",

      "S Our long-term economic growth is estimated to cut by 3 percent , while support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 percent of our gross domestic product ( GDP ) .\n",
      "S With such bleak outlook of our economy , our nation should be spending more wisely .\n",
      "S By making the responsibility of taking care of the elders to everyone in the society , public spending on the elders could and should then be limited .\n",
      "S Firstly , grown children should take care of their elderly parents .\n",
      "S By stressing on filial obligations and their duty to the aged , we can reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency .\n",
      "S However , the higher cost of living today makes such obligations quite impossible .\n",
      "S With high average inflation rate of 5.83 % globally ( Goldman Sachs , 2008 ) , it is very difficult for grown children to support both their family and parents .\n",
      "S Even so , it should not be an excuse as it actually does not take much to support the aged financially .\n",
      "S Young adults need to make an effort to save .\n",
      "S Also , especially in Asian societies , such as Singapore , older people are traditionally supported by their own families .\n",
      "S So , the grown children should continue with such tradition .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , in view of this dying tradition , the Maintenance of Parents Act is in place to tackle such issues .\n",
      "S Parents above sixty , who could not support themselves , can approach the tribunal for an order to claim maintenance from their children , delegating responsibility to the children .\n",
      "S Hence , with children supporting their parents , the government could save on the extra national budget .\n",
      "S Secondly , there are policies made to help the aged remain self reliant after retirement such as the mandatory saving scheme known as Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , the policies may not benefit all the aged .\n",
      "S For example , the CPF is not beneficial to the self employed unless they made an effort to deposit money into their CPF account .\n",
      "S Hence , the government has made several , not just one , policies .\n",
      "S For example , the lack of land in Singapore makes housing a valuable asset for Singaporeans .\n",
      "S To ensure all Singaporeans own their homes , the government gives generous subsidies for public housing .\n",
      "S As the nation prospers , these homes will appreciate in value , and Singaporeans may draw on this nest egg when they are old .\n",
      "S With such policies , the aged are ensured that they would have enough assets to remain self reliant and not depend on the government .\n",
      "S Hence , the government is then able to divert spending to the national growth .\n",

      "S The best way to be all right in old age is to have enough savings by working longer ( PM Lee Hsien Loong , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , companies can contribute by employing them .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , many elders lack skills .\n",

      "S In order to provide for the elderly , the working population will have to pay more in taxes .\n",
      "S Other than paying taxes , the working population still needs to pay for their personal and family expenses .\n",
      "S As a result , there will be very little funds left for leisure and other activities .\n",
      "S There will be an adverse impact on the economy if government spending on the aged is not limited .\n",
      "S Due to the need of raising taxes to provide for the elderly , local consumptions of goods may reduce significantly and foreign investors will consider relocating their investments .\n",
      "S If consumption of goods reduces significantly , there will be low credit flow in the economy , which will result in sluggish economic growth .\n",
      "S Also , when foreign investors relocate their investments , jobs will also be relocated to other geographic places , this result in fewer jobs for the population .\n",
      "S Even though limiting expenses on the aging population may sound irresponsible , doing this can be a way to help to cope with the problem .\n",
      "S Limiting expenses on the aging population will mean that the government will have more funds to utilize to attract foreign investors to the country .\n",
      "S They can also utilize these funds to improve public facilities to attract tourism ; tourism is one of the economic activities that can generate extra income to the country .\n",
      "S People will also become more affluent to spend and stimulate the economic growth .\n",
      "S As a result of economic growth , the government will be more able to pay for the retired elderly .\n",
      "S This will then become a snowballing effect causing further improvements in the economy .\n",
      "S Spending to develop the country can generate extra revenue to the country , creating a more affluent society .\n",
      "S This will be beneficial for the elderly and also the working population , as the more affluent society will be able to pay for the healthcare expenses of the elderly .\n",
      "S For the benefit of the whole society , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Other than the global warming phenomenon , the current aging population is also the main concern that the world is facing without definite resolution .\n",
      "S This aging phenomenon is most evident at the developed countries like Japan , Germany and Singapore where fertility rates are not increasing enough .\n",
      "S The growing number of elderly population around the world has certainly created huge impacts which in turn caused changes to the structure of current society .\n",
      "S Faced with this situation , governments and policy makers around the world have been providing solutions such as the introduction of economic policies , social policies , and architectural designs which benefit both elderly and the society .\n",
      "S One of the main solutions offered would be the economic policy that eases the financial situation of the elderly .\n",
      "S Some countries provide incentives to the elderly for their daily and long term needs .\n",
      "S One of the evident examples would be the health care subsidy which has been carried out by many developed countries such as Singapore , Japan , and the U.S. Others may object that too much are being spent on the elderly and this will hinder the growth of the country which is fundamentally more essential .\n",
      "S However , this argument may not be valid because elderly is considered as an integral part of a country that can not be totally excluded .\n",
      "S With the right economic plan and policies , elderly can effectively contribute back to the growth of the country .\n",
      "S As mentioned by Singapore prime minster Lee ( The Journal , 2009 ) , \" aging should be redefined as an opportunity rather than burden to the society \" .\n",
      "S Life-long employability would be one possible answer to this problem , as the elderly can be less dependent on state funding and , at the same time , contribute back to the growth of the country .\n",
      "S Furthermore , other than contributing to the country , the elderly parents are also an important part of the family as they possess invaluable knowledge and experience which can guide the younger generation .\n",
      "S As aging population in some aspect has been linked with the negative social impact , thus a social policy plays an important part to reduce the effect which will otherwise cause social disintegration of a country .\n",
      "S One important example would be the issue on Parents Maintenance Act of Singapore , which governs specifically the social relationship between parents and children .\n",
      "S One may argue that the social policy is not needed as it has already been perceived in the society itself .\n",
      "S However , the current economic situation and the decreasing fertility rate have left the young adults , who have no siblings to share costs , with no choice but to give up on their parents .\n",
      "S Furthermore , we should also consider the fact that society is changing over time and so does the social and cultural value of our tradition .\n",
      "S Particularly in Singapore , as a multiracial country , where many different cultures converge , the traditional Asian value of filial piety will continuously fade off .\n",
      "S Thus , the social policy plays an important part to maintain this relationship and also to reiterate the importance of filial piety into the mind of the young adults .\n",
      "S As people get older , they tend to be more dependent on others in their daily activities .\n",
      "S This dependency may hinder the activity of the people around them which may otherwise be productive in other way .\n",
      "S With this in mind , countries start to provide elder friendly architectural design to assist elderly in their daily activities as the aging population increases from time to time .\n",
      "S For instance , in Singapore , more housing and transportation modes are designed to provide elderly friendly design such as : rubber flooring , alarm system and supporting hand rails .\n",
      "S With the implementation of the elderly friendly design , elderly will be able demonstrate some level of independence .\n",
      "S Reduced dependency of the elderly would also result in better allocation of the country 's resources , as young adults would be able to concentrate on their career and social organizations would be able to direct their attention to the more needy ones .\n"

      "S It turns out to be a fun and exciting for the elderly .\n",
      "S This promotes bonding among different generations .\n",
      "S Having this festival , the government allows the elderly to enjoy their aging life together with their family members .\n",
      "S The government and the public have done so much over the past few years in helping the elderly in their aging process .\n",
      "S Policies and developments are in place to ensure that aging will not become a problem to the society but just a natural process in Singapore .\n",
      "S Aging population is one of the issues that Singapore is facing today .\n",
      "S The Singapore Department of Statistics ( Singstat ) mentioned in its Population Trend 2008 report that senior citizens aged 65 years and above make up of 8.5 % of the population and it will continue to rise .\n",
      "S Having an aging population is a challenge and there is a need for public spending to assist the aged throughout their aging process .\n",
      "S However , the amount of public spending on the aged should nonetheless be limited so that the money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Critics of this position point out that it is only right for the government to spend on the aged to recognize their contributions made to the country 's economy .\n",
      "S However , doing so and not limiting the public spending on them would have dire consequences on Singapore itself .\n",
      "S Firstly , the national budget will come under pressure .\n",
      "S Having an aging population meant that there will be lesser people in the workforce and this will have an impact on the country 's economy size .\n",
      "S And if public spending on the aged is not limited despite the decrease in the size of the workforce , the country 's economy will be negatively affected .\n",
      "S Secondly , the public money comes from taxing the workforce .\n",
      "S If public spending is not limited , this meant that the workforce may be further taxed to provide sufficient funds for the aged .\n",
      "S Not only that this would pressurize the workforce , it would also cause them to spend less as they have lesser discretionary income .\n",
      "S This action will ultimately affect the country 's economy .\n",
      "S Thus , it is necessary to limit public spending on the aged due to the negative consequences that would arise from doing the otherwise .\n",
      "S One may argue that the high cost of living calls the need for public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S However , measures have been taken by the government beforehand to help the aged ease their aging process .\n",
      "S One measure , linked through the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , is the CPF Life .\n",
      "S There may be a portion of the senior citizens who find it difficult to cope with the cost of living after retirement as they no longer have an income to support them .\n",
      "S Thus , in order to meet their needs , the government has came up with the CPF Life designed such that the elders will be able to receive a continuous steady stream of income base on their CPF contributions made during their working life .\n",
      "S Another measure that the government had taken was to include a Medisave account in the CPF Savings .\n",
      "S The money in the Medisave account was formed by a percentage of their income and could be for hospitalization expenses .\n",
      "S As the senior citizens are more prone to health sickness , having this Medisave account would greatly benefit them .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending on the aged could and should be limited as the government had came up with several approaches to help deal with the aging process .\n",
      "S Aging population should not be the only issue that is given most attention to as there are other areas of the country 's development that would require the public money .\n",
      "S For instance , the government should spend part of the national budget in trying to increase the fertility rate .\n",
      "S Singstat mentioned that despite the slight increase in fertility rate , the fertility rate is still considered low .\n",
      "S Having a low fertility rate would impact Singapore in the long run .\n",
      "S The government could probably use the national budget to provide incentives to encourage Singaporeans to do their part in increasing the fertility rate .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending on the aged should be limited as there are other areas of the development that would require the national budget .\n",
      "S In conclusion , though there should be public spending on the aged , it should nevertheless be limited .\n",
      "S This is because of the consequences related to doing the otherwise such as pressurizing the national budget as well as the workforce itself .\n"

      "S In order to help the society and people to cope with the changes , current research and development such as new technological inventions and employment schemes are being put in place .\n",
      "S Firstly , in many countries which have traffic lights at road conjunctions , the scenario of an elderly rushing to cross the traffic light is common because the elderly tends to have a slower pace in walking .\n",
      "S This is a concern for an aging population as there could be danger in crossing the roads when the traffic light has turned red .\n",
      "S To minimize the risk of elderly fatalities , the Singapore Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) has invented an Elderly-Friendly Traffic System .\n",
      "S The system uses the Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) technology to identify any elderly pedestrians who want to cross the road , then extend the 'green man ' timing , allowing the elderly to make their way across the roads safely .\n",
      "S It may be objected that if an elderly took too much time crossing the road , it may cause traffic congestion at the road conjunctions .\n",

      "S Thus , the system is put in place for elderly to cross safely on a reasonable amount of time .\n",
      "S This explains that the problems which will occur from an aging population have been well-thought and measures have been taken .\n",
      "S Secondly , in the present , mobile phones are used commonly and most of the people around the world have at least one mobile phone .\n",
      "S With the large demand for mobile phones , phone companies have to compete with each other by inventing fanciful mobile phones with many functions such as Internet , games , music player and more .\n",
      "S However , with the shift to an aging population , the purpose of possessing a mobile phone changes back to the original functions which are to keep in contact and for emergency .\n",
      "S Furthermore , as people gets older , the vision will become poorer and responsiveness might be slower than before .\n",
      "S Thus , phone companies take this opportunity to penetrate the market with elderly-friendly phones .\n",
      "S For example , Japan 's phone companies have actually offer phone models which have bigger screens and larger font sizes , enhanced audibility and easier- to-operate keys to attract the elderly .\n",
      "S This will satisfy the needs of the elderly for a phone .\n",
      "S At this point , one may wonder , even if the phones are elderly-friendly , it will not be feasible unless the elderly knows how to use the phone .\n",
      "S In contrast , the Japan phone companies which offer the elderly-friendly phones also offer a free one hour session on how to use the phone .\n",
      "S Therefore , this shows that the phone companies are attentive to issues regarding the aging population and have done action to help ease the aging process .\n",
      "S One argument against the large extent of current research and development/policies that helped to ease the aging process is the availability of jobs for the elderly .\n",
      "S Most of the companies are likely to avoid elderly employment as the elderly are often perceived to have lack of relevant knowledge and expertise for them to work or continue to work in the company .\n",
      "S However , it is not true as the government has implemented several schemes to help in the elderly employment .\n",
      "S For example , in Singapore , the Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience ( SPUR ) is an enhanced funding support scheme that will help both the companies and individuals to build stronger manpower capabilities and more enhanced skills .\n",
      "S Thus , with the encouragement and funding from the government , the companies will be more motivated to provide enhanced training for the existing employee or relevant training for the elderly to enter the company .\n",
      "S This will help in relieving the aging process .\n",
      "S Clearly , as the aging process continues , the importance of adapting to the changes brought forth by an aging population becomes greater .\n",
      "S With the help of current research and development/policies , the society and the people will be more prepared in adapting to an aging population .\n",
      "S If there are no measures taken to ease the aging process , the probability of the society and the people being overwhelmed by the problems might be greater .\n",

      "S Ever since the last 30 years , the young population in Singapore has shrunk tremendously .\n",
      "S Accounting for less than 4 % of the total population back in the 1960s , elderly aged 65 and above today constitute 7.3 % of the total population based on the Singapore Census of Population 2000 .\n",
      "S This projected a significant growth in the aging population through these years .\n",
      "S To accommodate to this current changing age structure , on-going development of government policies , covering areas like economics , social and architecture , have been carried out aggressively through these years .\n",

      "S Even though government had implemented so much policy to help ease the aging process , some people still viewed this as 'not sufficient enough' .\n",
      "S From what we can see today , the trend of elderly staying all by themselves or staying in the old folks ' homes has been on the rise .\n",
      "S Although some of the government 's policies are initiated with the goal of encouraging the young to look after their aged parents , it did not seem to work out as planned .\n",
      "S Due to the changing beliefs and values of the younger generation in the 21th century , many of them hope to achieve freedom in their financial status , personal life and other aspects of their life and thus deemed that staying with their aged parents will cause burden to them .\n",

      "S However , government initiated policies are not as inefficient after all .\n",
      "S One of the main causes of growing aging population is the low fertility rate in Singapore .\n",
      "S In today 's society , many couples choose to have fewer children due to the high living expenses and financial burden .\n",
      "S Due to that , Singapore is facing a serious declining fertility rate that resulted in huge difference between the aged and the young .\n",
      "S To overcome this problem , government policy is implemented to encourage Singaporean couples to have three or more children if family finances permit .\n",

      "S Under this scheme , a Children Development Account ( CDA ) will be opened .\n",

      "S To further tackle the rising trend , government also implemented different housing schemes so as to better allow the families to look after their aged parents rather than putting them in old folks ' homes or leaving them to look after themselves .\n",

      "S The scheme , introduced last year , is a key piece in a comprehensive plan to tackle the problem of an aging population , with people 's retirement savings not keeping pace with longer life spans .\n",
      "S For example , some of the CPF members will receive up to $ 4000 depending on their income level and annual value of their home .\n",
      "S By this , the member will not need to worry about the retirement life later .\n",

      "S Globally , there is a rising concern on the rapidly aging of population , especially in the developed countries , for example , the U.S. Census Bureau projects the number of elderly Americans will nearly double to 71 million by 2030 .\n",
      "S Many countries are starting to pump in money into research and introducing policies to ease the aging process as it will lead to problems like widening of tax base and healthcare shortage .\n",
      "S While current research and policies have helped to ease the aging process , there are limitations to these policies that make these policies not as effective as a result .\n",
      "S The policies that the government introduced and the current research have indeed helped to buffer the aging process .\n",
      "S The government has introduced effective economic policies to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S These economic policies are important as they will help to promote economic growth for the country .\n",
      "S Without growth , a country will not have the financial ability to be able to provide welfare benefits and to support the needy , usually the elderly .\n",
      "S One of the economic policies introduced is encouraging longer working lives .\n",
      "S For example , the Singapore government extended the CPF Minimum Sum withdrawal age from 62 to 65 , which in turn delayed the age of retirement .\n",
      "S This policy is effective in the sense that it not only increases the size of the working population so that the government will not have to increase the tax base , but also helps the elderly to save up more money for their future need after they retire .\n",
      "S Therefore , this economic policy helps to promote growth for the country and also helps the elderly to prepare for their old age .\n",
      "S Medical research is one crucial element in easing the aging process .\n",
      "S In view of an aging population , the government knew that healthcare is one major sector that they can not neglect .\n",
      "S As people are having longer life expectancy now and the aging population is going to make up a quarter of the population by year 2030 in country like Singapore , more people will be demanding for better healthcare as they grow older .\n",
      "S This is because as people grow older , most are bound to suffer from age-related diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's disease .\n",
      "S Thus , the government is investing large amount of money into medical research on age-related diseases and bringing in new medical technology .\n",
      "S These research and technology will be used in finding new cures for certain disease , developing of new treatment and increasing the success rate of surgery .\n",
      "S For example , in the United States , there is federal funding of $ 1.4 billion annually in research that is crucial to finding ways to treat and prevent Alzheimer 's .\n",
      "S Therefore , these investments on medical research will definitely be very useful in the near future .\n",
      "S However , there are limitations as to how effective the research and policies will be .\n",
      "S The research and technologies brought in are very expensive which makes it available only for the people who can afford it and the poor , who can barely make their ends meet , will not be the beneficiaries .\n"

      "S In the recent years , the changing demographic of Singapore has cause the government and policymakers to channel more resources and revise public policies for the elderly .\n",
      "S If the government still does not intervene , the working-age population will come under more pressure as the elderly persons are mostly taken care by them .\n",
      "S Furthermore , if it is not properly handled , more issues relating to aging population will arise causing serious consequences to the growth of the country .\n",
      "S To deal with the challenges ahead , the government has implemented a few measures in terms of health care services , retirement policy and provision of housing to help the elderly .\n",
      "S With the help from voluntary welfare organization , there is a range of health care services available to help the older people in the community .\n",
      "S These health care services provided are such as day care centres , senior citizens club and residential care .\n",
      "S However , at times these services are not fully utilized as it lack of publicity and the location may not be accessible to some of the elderly who do not stay near the health care centres .\n",
      "S Therefore , mostly these health care centres are located to the places where a high proportion of older people are staying .\n",
      "S These services are a great support and assistance to the working age people who are taking care of the elderly while they are busy working .\n",
      "S Moreover , Social activities such as games , keep fit exercises and karaoke sessions are organized to engage the elderly in a healthy sociable lifestyle .\n",
      "S With more of these health care services around , the elderly can remain physically and socially active , and it also help to lighten the burden of the working age population .\n",
      "S Currently , Government is encouraging more healthy and able elderly to work longer by lowering barriers of elder employment policy .\n",
      "S It may be objected that having older employees will also mean higher cost in term of healthcare benefits and insurances .\n",
      "S In such case , companies will find them as a huge financial burden slowing the growth of the companies .\n",
      "S But , on the other hand , companies do save up a lot in their training costs as these employees are more experienced , and retaining them will cut down on the recruitment costs .\n",
      "S By working longer , there is more time to ensure that the valuable experience and knowledge are passed on to the younger members of the workforce .\n",
      "S Countries such as Japan and United States are also encouraging more people to work longer by extending the retirement age up to sixty-five .\n",
      "S In addition , with still a good medical condition and good working performance , these people can be a great asset in contributing to the economy .\n",
      "S Hence , encouraging later retirement will benefit the elderly in saving up more for their old age and the economy of the country .\n",
      "S Nowadays , there are more supports given by the government for the family to take care of the older person .\n",
      "S Schemes like Joint Selection Scheme that allows the children to apply for flats in the same block or housing estates of their parents .\n",
      "S Another is the Multi-Tier Family Housing Scheme which grants a lower down payment and maximum loans for those who opt for it .\n",
      "S There are also more upgrading of older estates to improve accessibility such as more rams and lifts .\n",
      "S Even public transportation is more disabled and elderly friendly these days .\n",
      "S In addition , beautifying with modern design and interior improvements of older housing estates is a strategy to prevent outflow of younger people .\n",
      "S Therefore , with the continual support from the government is important to promote children to stay with their elderly parents .\n",
      "S With the growing demand of the rapidly rising aging population , dealing with these issues is inevitable .\n",
      "S These issues are also faced by other developed countries such as Japan and United States .\n",
      "S In order to deal with these rising issues , government is currently taking active measures to help ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , there can only be so much that the government can help in terms of the health care services and policies .\n",
      "S If these services are not fully utilized by the people and the elderly are not responding to the government assistance , slowly these older people could be considered as not productive and be neglected by the society .\n",
      "S After World War II , we saw a rapid increase in the birth rate across the globe and Singapore too , faces the same problem .\n",
      "S With an increase in the fertility rate accompanied with an increase in the life expectancy of the population , Singapore was soon faced with an overcrowded population .\n",
      "S In order to prevent the situation from deteriorating , the government imposed strict policies in an attempt to reduce the birth rate .\n",
      "S For instance , civil servants are not entitled for paid maternity leave for the third and subsequent child .\n",
      "S In addition , public hospitals charge increasingly higher sum for each additional birth .\n",
      "S This move was proven to be effective as the fertility rate in Singapore dropped from 3.0 in 1970 to 1.7 in 1980 .\n",
      "S However , by 1986 , the Singapore government became aware of the low birth rate problem within the country and hence decided to come out with the \" Have Three or More , if You Can Afford It \" policy .\n",
      "S Monetary incentives are given to both the parent and the third and subsequent child .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , the policy did not work due to the rising cost of living and additional responsibility for each additional child .\n",
      "S With improved medical facilities these days , the life expectancy of the population has increased .\n",
      "S With low birth rate and longer life expectancy , aging population become a long term problem for Singapore .\n",
      "S Knowing the difficulties in encouraging Singaporeans to have more children , the government and related organizations decided to carry out research studies and have implemented policies to ease the aging process in different areas such as the medical field .\n",
      "S In order to combat the shrinking workforce , caused by the rapid ageing population and a declining fertility rate , the Health authorities must first gear up their medical field and prepare for an aging population .\n",
      "S Due to the fact that older patients are more prone to hospital admittances than the other age groups , providing better medical care facilities and services not only helps to reduce the chance of re-admission , it will also facilitate better chances of making a full recovery .\n",
      "S With less frequent visits to the hospital , the amount of money spent on medical bills would decrease .\n",
      "S Hence , the elderly would be able live longer with his retirement funds .\n",
      "S However , to develop the medical sector , huge sum of funds has to be involved which may in turn hamper the development of other sectors .\n",
      "S Moreover , the drugs have to be tested so as to ensure the effectiveness of the medicine and are safe for consumption .\n",
      "S On the other hand , with the rise in aging population , it is inevitable to invest heavily in the medical sector as poor medical facilities will lead to more health problems within the country .\n",
      "S This will then result in an increase in the amount spent on medications , thus adding greater financial burden to the shrinking workforce .\n",
      "S With the constant rise in cost of living , families can no longer rely on a sole breadwinner as they need to support both their parents as well as their children in terms of food , shelter and education .\n"

      "S Hence , it would be a wise decision for both adults to work in order to ease the financial burden of the family .\n",
      "S However , by easing the financial burden of the family , it may result in neglecting their obligations to look after their parents .\n",
      "S Furthermore , if either of their parents contracts a long term disease which requires significant amount of care , both the adults will be in a dilemma whether to look after their parents or carry on with their job so as to ease the financial burden that is added on because of the medical bills .\n",
      "S Either decision requires one party to sacrifice , thus the Singapore government decided to offer more step-down care services which provides basic medical care to the elderly after the patient have been stabilized .\n",
      "S With these services , working adults can still fulfill their filial obligation as children and maintain a manageable financial burden .\n",
      "S In the recent rally speech by the Prime Minister Lee Lee Hsien Loong , he mentioned that \" the best way to keep health care costs down is to maintain healthy lifestyles \" such as going for regular checkups and exercising regularly .\n",

      "S In a nutshell , the medical sector played a significant role in easing the aging process by providing high level of medical care and wellbeing to the senior citizens .\n",
      "S However , the elderly themselves are also responsible for their own wellbeing by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and going for regular checkups .\n",

      "S In response , Singapore has devised strategies to cushion the impact .\n",
      "S In view of these strategies implemented , I agreed to a large extent that the current research and development of policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S The first policy development is in medial field .\n",
      "S There is an increased demand for health care services by the aging population .\n",
      "S Having quality health care services at affordable prices is viewed as one of the most important need for the aging population .\n",
      "S The first strategy implemented by Singapore is to have a seamless community-based health care system .\n",
      "S This strategy calls for having private clinics to be within a hundred metres from the homes .\n",
      "S The polyclinics , community hospitals , long term care centres and regional hospitals should be located within two to six kilometres .\n",
      "S The aim is to minimize the number of hospital trips made .\n",
      "S It has already been carried out in the northern and western parts of Singapore .\n",
      "S The second strategy devised is the implementation of mean- testing .\n",
      "S This strategy calls for graduated levels of subsidies that are based on either the patient 's income or the house type .\n",
      "S The subsidies can be up to eighty percent of the total bill .\n",
      "S It is supported by reducing the subsidies of financially well-off .\n",
      "S Thus , the two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the health care services .\n",
      "S The second policy development is in economic field .\n",
      "S Three main factors have caused the total fiscal cost to be increasing at an increased rate .\n",
      "S Firstly , more subsidized health care treatments are being sought .\n",
      "S Secondly , treatment costs have increased in relation to the tremendous advancements made in medical science technologies .\n",
      "S Thirdly , more financial help are being sought from the government .\n",
      "S The first strategy implemented is the setup of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) .\n",
      "S The purpose is to provide a compulsory and comprehensive saving plan for Singaporeans .\n",
      "S In response to the changing economic landscape , several major changes have been made .\n",
      "S Some of the changes are the increase of CPF minimum sum and the partial withdrawal of the retirement savings upon reaching retirement age .\n",
      "S The second strategy implemented is the raise of the retirement age to sixty two years old .\n",
      "S The original retirement age was set at fifty five years old .\n",
      "S As people are living longer and healthier , there is an increased need to save up for future expenditures .\n",
      "S Allowing later retirement will allow wealth accumulation .\n",
      "S Another benefit is that valuable working experience can be retained and imparted to the inexperienced .\n",
      "S This will lead to a higher productivity rate .\n",
      "S Thus , these two policies have helped to ease the aging process by cushioning the impact on the economy .\n",
      "S However , critics have pointed out that it is the motivation of individuals , instead of policies , helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Having a quality and affordable health care system will be ineffective if individuals do not take care of themselves .\n",
      "S Without the determination of individuals to work past their prime and increase their wealth accumulation , implementing good economic policies will also be ineffective .\n",
      "S However , the critics failed to point out that even though individuals may be unwilling to save up ; the economic policies implemented have actually helped indirectly in wealth accumulation .\n",
      "S Unless the individuals are self-employed , part of their monthly salary will go towards CPF and special interest rates are given for the amount held .\n",
      "S They also have not point out that Singapore has taken basic measures to ensure the general well-being of its citizens .\n",
      "S For example , it is compulsory for newly-born to take BCG vaccination against Tuberculosis .\n",
      "S The integration of the health care service providers through the medical policies will result in higher quality and more affordable health care system .\n",
      "S For economic policies , having CPF and raising the retirement age will allow additional wealth accumulation .\n",
      "S Thus , the development of these policies has helped to ease aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S Ageing has always been a concern of many as no one can escape the ageing process and it has never been an easy task going through it .\n",
      "S However , with the likes of current medical research and policies , the ageing process has been eased to a large extent as compared to decades ago .\n",

      "S Therefore , medical research greatly enhances the confident of aged to face the eventual ageing process .\n",

      "S Lastly , the HDB grant policy also displays how the government helps to ease the ageing process .\n",
      "S The policy aims to promote filial piety while helping filial children to decrease the burden of owning a property with a $ 20 000 grant .\n",
      "S Even if a minority will have no intention to take care of their parents , perhaps due to the fact that their parents did not carry out their parental duties faithfully for an instance , but still chose to live with them in order to obtain the $ 20 000 subsidy , there are still many that thought otherwise .\n",
      "S This policy not only help to minimize the fear of not being taken care of when one aged , weaken the negative idea that living with parents only increase one 's expenditure but also diminish the worries of aged parents that their children will not have a roof over their head .\n",
      "S Clearly , the current research and policies have help to ease the ageing process tremendously .\n",
      "S The breakthrough in the medical research field , not only provide a cushion for the aged with regards to old age illnesses but also help to reduce their future medical expenditure .\n",
      "S Similarly , the CPF policy , put into operation by government , lessens the worries of ageing as medical and life expenses aspects are already well planned for .\n",
      "S Finally the HDB grant policy decreases the worries of the aged living with their children .\n",
      "S It is relatively hard to deny how much ageing had been made much easier .\n",
      "S Aging is a continuous , complex , and dynamic process .\n",

      "S The internet also provides a platform for elderly individuals to network and socialize with one another without stepping out of their house .\n",
      "S These provide great convenience especially to elderly individuals who have difficulties moving around .\n",
      "S Apart from that , advancement in technology also brings about the inventions of new gadgets that have significantly improved the lives of the elderly individuals .\n",
      "S For example in Japan , mobile phone manufacturer has come up with mobile phone that has large key pad so that the elderly can use it without straining their eyes .\n",
      "S Similarly , wheelchairs are being made automated , so that elderly individuals , who are too weak to walk , will still be able to move around freely and independently .\n",
      "S Economic policies implemented by the government have also helped to ease the process of aging .\n",
      "S For example in Singapore , the government has implemented the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) LIFE scheme that will provide lifelong income for the elderly in their retirement .\n",
      "S Under this scheme , they can get around $ 360 to $ 440 per month upon reaching the age of 62 .\n",
      "S As a result , elderly individuals can enjoy their retirement without having much financial worries .\n",
      "S Elderly individuals are generally more prone to illnesses as their immune system would have weakened due to aging .\n",
      "S In addition to that , they are more likely to be plagued with old age diseases like Parkinson or dementia .\n",
      "S The government foreseeing that personal medical expenses would rise as one aged , implemented the Medisave scheme to meet their healthcare needs .\n",
      "S Basically , this scheme helps individuals to put aside part of their income into their Medisave account to meet their future personal medical expenses .\n",
      "S Therefore , they do not have to worry for medical expenses when they are old .\n",
      "S Besides that , the government also provides financial assistance to needy elderly individuals who do not have the means to pay their medical expenses .\n",
      "S Social policies are also implemented to ease the process of aging .\n",
      "S For example in Singapore , the government has set up a $ 10million Golden Opportunities Fund to create more programmes , activities and learning opportunities for the elderly individuals .\n",
      "S This fund will be used to construct more elder-friendly facilities in all sports centre and within housing estates .\n",
      "S Therefore , through this policy , they can pursue the lifestyle of their choice , be it sports , learning , or contributing through volunteering in non-profit organizations .\n",
      "S In conclusion , advancement in technology , economic policies and social policies implemented by the government has helped to ease the process of aging .\n",
      "S Elderly individuals are able to live freely , independently and fruitfully while pursuing their choice of life after retirement .\n",

      "S Thus we are forgoing our morals when we are trying to achieve the best economic way to ensure that dependency still lies within the family and not rely it on the government .\n",
      "S Furthermore , Parents Maintenance Act may not be entirely successful in getting the children to pay for their dependent parent maintenance .\n",
      "S This is because the act is only applicable if parents go forward to report against their children and this is applicable only if parents are aware of such an act as well as they bear to do that to their children .\n",
      "S And children can only abide to the obligations if they are financially stable .\n",
      "S Therefore this act is rather ineffective in solving the problems of unwanted old parents , and in the context of social well being , it is unsuccessful .\n",
      "S Another strategies in solving ageing population would be to increase the birth .\n",
      "S With increasing population , there is an increase in working population , leading to an increase in income tax and thus solving both problems of shortage of labour force and well as the heavy financial strain placed on the economically active population .\n",
      "S Pro-natalist policy has been implemented since early 1990s yet the effectiveness it has on birth remains questionable .\n",
      "S Despite much efforts put in by the government in shaping a policy that aims to lessen the financial burden of having children , fertility rates still remain low , as low as 1.08 which is way below replacement rate .\n",
      "S Pro-natalist policy focus mainly on the cash incentives such as baby bonuses of $ 3,00 for the 1st and 2nd child , up to $ 6,000 for the 3rd and 4th child as well as the government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings the parents contribute to their child 's Children Development Account .\n",
      "S However , in Singapore , the financial burden is less of a concern when we are targeting on the 'productive group ' of the population .\n",
      "S In the sense that government actually believes in \" Smart people born smart children \" , so when they are encouraging population growth they are targeting on the educated ones , who are also the financially stable ones .\n",
      "S Thus cash incentives are not a strong enough factor to encourage them to give birth , as money is a less important issue to them .\n",
      "S On the other hand , it can also be argued that raising up a long term process and government 's help in terms of baby bonus and Children development account is temporally , to the age of six .\n",
      "S So it is in fact rather limited , and it makes people think twice added the other considerations such as high cost of living in Singapore and the increasingly competitive society we are living in makes the task of raising up a child well challenging .\n",
      "S Therefore , the pro-natalist is rather unsuccessful in easing ageing population through the encouraging of births due to several other considerations people have when they decides to have a child besides the cash incentives .\n",

      "S \" I agree to this statement to a large extent .\n",
      "S National budget has always been something that most taxpayers pay much attention to and the planning of annual expenditure is always a big challenge in order to meet the ever changing needs of the country .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted into more important areas of the country development , mainly health , education and defense .\n",
      "S Budget to the health sector is essential in every country as reduced healthcare facilities and equipments will lead to reduced man-hours as people fall sick and they are unable to receive adequate medical attention .\n",
      "S This will affect the country 's development in both the social and economical aspect .\n",
      "S Therefore emphasis needs to be placed when it comes to health budget .\n",
      "S In the case of Singapore , a total budget of $ 3705 million has been allocated to the Ministry of Health for Financial Year 2009 CITATION Hea09 \\ l 1033 ( Ministry of Finance , 2009 ) which is quite a large sum of money .\n",
      "S Some might argue that more money should be allocated to taking care of the elderly in the healthcare sector as the elderly are more prone towards chronic diseases and other health problems .\n",
      "S However , I think that this is an oversimplification and is not practical .\n",
      "S It will be much better for the money to be diverted into researching for new medicines and vaccines and improving healthcare facilities which is more important in the current situation when viruses are getting more adapted to current medications and a pandemic is more relevant to us .\n",
      "S Furthermore , it will also be better if the money is diverted into more subsidies when it comes to medical charges such that healthcare remains affordable for all citizens , which will also benefit the aged as well .\n",
      "S Emphasis should also be place on the education sector as it is crucial to the country 's development .\n",
      "S Education is fundamental for the nation as it builds the nation 's foundation since young .\n",
      "S It is necessary and can not be cut down even at the current stage of economic downturn .\n",
      "S Singapore has spent a large amount of budget on education , roughly rounding to about $ 8701 million in Financial Year 2009 CITATION Hea09 \\ l 1033 ( Ministry of Finance , 2009 ) .Some people might advise on educating the elderly as being one important aspect of the nation 's development as it promotes lifelong learning .\n",
      "S However , educating the old will spend a considerate amount of money as most of their minds are not as active as the young and they will take a longer time to absorb new knowledge .\n",
      "S The focus at the current stage should be setting a strong foundation on the young and the working class rather than spending money on the elderly .\n",
      "S In this economic downturn , it will be more efficient if we set a strong base through education so that our workforce will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to tackle problems and future challenges in life and work when the economy picks up .\n",
      "S Defence is also a major component that we have to place focus in when we talk about the country 's development .\n",
      "S The country 's aim is to enhance peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy ; when these fail , it will ensure a swift victory over the aggressor .\n",
      "S In Singapore , defense has the highest percentage of the budget allocated in Financial Year 2009 , rounding to about $ 11.45 billion , which is about 26.4 % of the national budget CITATION Hea09 \\ l 1033 ( Ministry of Finance , 2009 ) .Some people might dispute that the aged is a valuable asset as we can tap into their vast experience when it comes to defense .\n",
      "S However , in this fast paced and ever changing society , the experiences of the aged will get more irrelevant and money will be better used if the public spending on the aged can be diverted into defense to maintain peace so that social and economical aspect of the nation can flourish .\n",
      "S In conclusion , I believe that there is indeed a need for there to be public spending on the aged as the aged are still able to contribute much when it comes to the nation 's development , more through their experiences in life .\n",
      "S However , there have to be a limitation on how much we spend on them so that the money can be diverted into areas like health , education and defense which are much more important areas and crucial to the country 's development .\n",

      "S Strategies for easing aging process\n",
      "S Due to the ageing of the baby-boomers and the lower fertility rates in the first-world countries , the unprecedented problem of a fast ageing population has become governments ' and policy markers ' concern in the developed world .\n",
      "S And Singapore , as one of the developed countries having one of the fastest elderly populations in the world , which had around 235,000 elderly population aged 65 year old and above ( or7 % of the population ) in 1999 while this figure being going to reach 796,000 ( or19 % of the population ) by the year 2030 ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) , needs to face this serious challenge and ease the negative impact on society .\n",
      "S The final objective of \" Successful Ageing for Singapore \" ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) , which has been brought up by Committee on Ageing Issues ( CAI ) established in Dec 2004 and representing from the various sectors in Singapore like the people , private and government , is to ensure that at the individual level , elder Singaporeans should be healthy , active and secure , as well as that all levels of society are well prepared to face an ageing Singapore with challenges and opportunities .\n",
      "S With approaching this goal , current research and development/ policies , to a large extent , have helped to ease the aging process in different fields , like psychology , medicine , etc. On the other hand , the situation of the fast ageing population in Singapore is still rigorous , even with various research and development/ policies .\n",
      "S However , there is one thing , which should be faced , that although such tend of a fast ageing population is unlikely to be reversed in a short term ; much can still be done to buffer its negative impact on society .\n",
      "S In the area of psychology , the effort refers to the individuals ' and society 's values , perceptions , together with attitudes of ageing and the elder person .\n",
      "S Positive orientations , ones which will encourage society to maximize the great potential and resource that senior citizens stand for , will be adopted .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in order to bring out a brainstorm and change mindsets of elderly , a systematic year-round public education ( PE ) program ( Committee on Ageing Issues , n.d. ) should be conducted , instead of a week-long activity driven by a citizen-led committee , to infuse a culture of personal responsibility and lifelong planning for old age .\n",
      "S With launching this PE program , negative attitudes about ageing will be dispelled ; moreover active lifestyles and community involvement among older Singaporeans will be promoted , which follows with strengthening intergenerational bonds , allowing the elder to age with respect and dignity , as well as approaching independent and fulfilling lives as integral members of their families and communities In the area of medicine , a series of efforts has been implemented .\n",
      "S First of all , a restructure of the whole healthcare system will be built for an ageing population in Singapore , which has been claimed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ( Channel NewsAsia , August 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Second , besides more new hospitals to be constructed , Singapore 's step-down care sector needs working on , one which for now is largely provided by voluntary welfare organizations ( VWO ) , including more community hospitals nursing homes and home care .\n",
      "S With linking up acute hospitals with community ones , this one key step provides appropriate care to the elder , meanwhile reduces the expenditure which is usually not a small amount , along with spares beds in the acute hospital for more acute cases which need to be treated .\n",
      "S In additional , this policy emphasizes the strengths of both entities : the profession of the government 's hospital teams delivers high quality care to patients , while VWO are good at pastoral care and community outreach .\n",
      "S ( Healthcare system to be restructured to cater to ageing population .\n",
      "S August 2009 .\n",
      "S Channel NewsAsia )\n",
      "S Although the whole ageing issue in Singapore would be tackled by no one-off recommendation , the effect of these strategies has become more and more obvious .\n",
      "S With every effort put into these strategies , especially current researches and developments/ policies in the various areas like psychology , medicine , etc. , the ageing process in Singapore has been eased to a large extent , which is hard to deny .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged has been rising rapidly due to the ageing population , because people need more health care as they grow older .\n",
      "S This has been a major concern for the government because such massive yet increasing spending on the aged would mean a high possibility of economic and fiscal crisis for the near future ( Public Sector HealthCare Roundtable , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited to a certain extent , not only to avoid the high possibility of economic crisis in the near future , but also to divert the attention to other areas such as education and infrastructure development , which are essential for the economic growth of a country .\n",
      "S The increase of public spending on the aged is necessary because of the ageing population .\n",
      "S It is crucial to spend more to offset the balance of the number of older people now and back then , so as to maintain the complacent stage to prevent any public objection or difficulty to adapt to lesser financial assistance .\n",
      "S However , there are other useful measures that could be taken to reduce the amount of public spending on the elderly .\n",
      "S For example , Peterson states that \" elder dependency should be reduced by encouraging later retirement , longer working lives , and lower barriers to elder employment \" .\n",
      "S Another strategy that he stated would be to emphasize filial obligation and encourage the willingness of tomorrow 's grown children , so as to lower the government spending on elder dependency .\n",
      "S This could be achieved through informal and familial channels ( Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged is necessary , but we should not eliminate other possibilities that will ease the financial aspects of the ageing population .\n",
      "S However , education also plays a crucial role for the wealth and future development of a country .\n",
      "S For instance , education teaches us the correct attitude and courtesy , thus making us civilized .\n",
      "S In addition , it assists us in the development of our virtues and values , and it also cultivates us into mature individuals , who are able of planning for our futures and taking the correct steps .\n",
      "S When the people are well-educated , the advancement of a country 's economy will be promised ( Manali Oak , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Education at the secondary and tertiary level will prepare the students to be efficient when they enter the working society , by equipping them with the necessary knowledge and essential skills .\n",
      "S When the efficiency of the workforce is high , it will benefit the economic growth of the country greatly .\n",

      "S Some other people might say that CPF savings is not enough to cover throughout their whole retired lives .\n",
      "S Well , it depends on individuals to plan out their own personal savings for future as CPF is just a way to help those who might not have planned their savings for old-age , to make sure the difficulties that every nation might be facing are reduced .\n",
      "S This is the intention of the government to protect his people .\n",
      "S Another form of way through financial policy is the ElderShield .\n",

      "S ElderShield is viewing at the lengthening life expectancy of Singaporeans where people tend to live longer compared to past years , and thus one should be able to deposit some savings in the productive years for old age disabilities .\n",
      "S A certain people may think that the government has nothing else better to do to set up this scheme which is not needed and is a waste of money as they already have MediShield in CPF account and assumed that they will never get severe disabilities in the future .\n",

      "S Although \" the eligibility criteria are very stringent and older persons with living children normally have a very slim chance of getting approval , the rates do not follow Singapore 's rising inflation .\n",

      "S By then , one out of every five residents will be a senior .\n",
      "S \" ( Executive summary , Committee on Ageing Issues : Report on the Ageing Population ) Thus , an outcry of more spending on the aged is rising in Singapore .\n",
      "S However , government should limit the spending on the aged due to the ageing issues requires help and also largely depended on other areas of the country .\n",
      "S As the country will have less working force in 2030 , the government should invest more money on education to obtain a stronger working force to support the country and the large group of elderly .\n",
      "S \" Each additional year of schooling appears to raise earnings by about 10 percent in the United States , although the rate of return to education varies over time as well as across countries .\n",
      "S \" ( Krueger and Lindahl 2001 ) With more investment in education , the standard of the working force in Singapore will increase .\n",
      "S And each individual worker will receive more income due to the high output and competitive of the Singapore working force .\n",
      "S At the same time , better education will not only improve the earning of the working force , but also the moral of the younger generation .\n",
      "S Singapore will not be able to solve the ageing issues if the younger generation of Singapore is lack of moral and only put their focus on themselves .\n",
      "S However , Singapore has already invested much money in education , and by putting more money inside education may not have a better outcome .\n",
      "S The truth is the world is changing fast and many developing countries such as China , India and Vietnam are catching up with Singapore .\n",
      "S If Singapore stops her development in education and put her focus mainly in ageing issues , she might lose in the future .\n",
      "S Thus , invest money in education is important , relevant and important .\n",

      "S The recent bombings in Indonesia hotels and the escape and recapture of Mas Selamat show that Singapore is in danger all the time .\n",
      "S Also , Singapore needs to build up a stronger economic defense to prevent serious economic recessions due to that large amount of money need to be spent on elderly in the nearly future .\n",
      "S Yet , some reports suggest that to invest more money on elderly will benefit the country more compare to invest money on defense which seems a waste of resources .\n",
      "S The fact is that , the effect on defense is hardly observed to the public due to the people have been living in a safe environment for too long , that most of them think that Singapore is safe with or without the defense system .\n",
      "S So , if the government do not invest enough and promote better defense system , Singapore might have serious problems when huge crises such as terroist attackes the 1997 economic recession happen .\n",
      "S At last , to limit the spending on ageing issues help to force the society to take responsibility and not totally rely on government alone .\n",

      "S It is understandable that the public and the elderly are worried that if the government does not spend much on the ageing issues , the elderly will be forgotten by the society .\n",
      "S Yet , the truth is opposite .\n",
      "S If the government takes all the responsibility , the public will take granted of the problem just like how most of the people take safety of Singapore as an easy thing to achieve .\n",
      "S Thus , the government should limited the spending on ageing and at the same time , educate the public and solve the problem together .\n",
      "S The ageing issues will not be able to be solved in a short period of time .\n",

      "S For placing an unlimited amount of public spending directly targeted at the aged , the government will be neglecting the economy , social and political issues which in a way , acts as platforms for better living conditions of the aged in the future which will be discussed further .\n",
      "S There is absolutely no wrong in allocating a bulk of public spending on the aged , but who is to justify and judge the magnitude of spending and the determinants to a reasonable amount which leads us to the role of the government .\n",
      "S The yearly Singapore Budget Speech actually recognizes the fact that someone has to make a policy or guidelines to justify and judge the absolute yet flexible amount of public spending in peace times or states of emergency , even though there were criticisms of the government to have squandered savings by her own policy of industrial targeting .\n",
      "S ( Gerald P. O'Driscoll 2002 ) Besides , consider solely on the economic perspective , Singapore will never be a leading nation if there is no control but relinquishment over public spending with abrupt and undefined monetary policies , basically meaning that there is justification to the planning of public spending .\n",
      "S Moving on to the point of channeling more funds into the financial world , it provides a higher possibility of a better economy , although no single entity till date can guarantee that .\n",
      "S Still , the government has to seriously consider the fact that a better economy will bring about higher employment rate , higher real income and lower price inflation indicated by the Consumer Price Index , which enables the now active Singaporeans in the workforce to save for the future .\n",
      "S In other words , financial planning which Peterson in A Graying World states to be a strategy to a new paradigm of ageing , ( Peterson 2001 ) where the government is recognising the importance of planning with more than 600 financial institutions in Singapore that makes the country one of the top ten most sophisticated financial markets in the world by the World Economic Forum .\n",
      "S ( Kei 2009 ) For the government of Singapore to substantiate our standings in the financial markets of the world , she has to continue to provide incentives , coming from the areas of world-class infrastructures , investment avenues , tourism and trade , those of which require a sizeable amount of public spending , for the experts in the field to come in .\n",
      "S Understanding is of the same or higher significance in terms of educating the society .\n",
      "S Discussing this in a narrow context of financial planning would mean that the government first has to groom potential leaders and scholars to understand the importance of financial planning before they can lead and share .\n",
      "S Grooming then , comes in the form of a more sophisticated infrastructure for learning and monetary incentives or aids in scholarships and bursaries .\n",
      "S Not forgetting that through the functions of education , the government can increase or influence the citizens ' thoughts and awareness on being socially and morally responsible to the population , including the aged as well , quoting the threats of the flu epidemics .\n",
      "S In addition , the government has to work hand-in-hand with social organizations like the CIMO help groups to allow rooms for them to help their ethnic groups financially , especially for the old aged .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending into the societal issues is of certain importance as well .\n",
      "S In conclusion , we have to consider public spending on the other areas of concerns other than that of an ageing population to be of an indirect manner to help and ease the aged but in the future milieu , and too note the consequence of incompetent allocation of resources namely , having unlimited public spending on the aged .\n",

      "S Though Peterson in The Graying World ( 2001 ) maintains that the elderly could depend less on the public spending by seeking employment or depending more on their family , such a notion at reducing and limiting elder dependency is not feasible .\n",
      "S Being old does not come with the loss of health but there is a social prejudice against the elderly when they seek employment at their age .\n",
      "S In this competitive age , employers will tend to favour the non-elderly over the elderly as the latter is nearly retirement and often associated with old diseases .\n",

      "S Should public spending on the aged make way for the country 's development on all other areas ?\n",

      "S It can be said that aging could be supported by oneself or by one 's children and hence the need for public spending would be reduced .\n",

      "S Money should be spent on education , research and growing the country 's economy so that people can have larger income to tap upon .\n",
      "S In addition , instead of spending on the aged , the attention could be to encourage more birth rates and stressing the importance of filial piety as a value so that the aged can more securely depend on their children .\n",
      "S In this way , focusing on growing the country 's economy to help to support the aged seems to be wise .\n",

      "S There is a gap between the rich and the poor .\n",

      "S If their savings runs out , they would face difficulty acquiring income as their abated bodies limit them in finding a job .\n",
      "S They would end up living on the streets if no help is given to them .\n",
      "S Furthermore , poor elderly can not afford expensive medical bills , but they should not be disqualified to receive medical treatment as it is needed to sustain their lives .\n",
      "S Hence , help is heavily needed from the government to keep the poor aged to survive .\n",
      "S Grants and subsidies should be given for health check-ups and medical treatments .\n",

      "S In the recent years , global aging issues are an uprising concern .\n",
      "S The population in many developed countries is aging , and Singapore is no exception .\n",
      "S If fertility rate does not increase , these issues will worsen , as the average age of the population will increase .\n",
      "S If this maintains , by 2030 , the ratio of one out of every five Singaporeans will be aged 65 or above .\n",
      "S The aging population will definitely cause a great impact on the society .\n",
      "S Thus over the years , the new researches , developments and policies in Singapore have definitely helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S And as far as these developments and policies are concern , ageing workforce and the cost for elderly healthcare are the important factors that the government has looked into .\n",
      "S By looking into these factors , the country can greatly decrease the impact of the liabilities these elderly has on the country .\n",
      "S To prevent older generations to be a burden to younger generations , the Singapore government has come up with several policies and acts which allows the elderly to stay in the workforce for a longer period .\n",
      "S One of the acts enforced is the Retirement Act .\n",
      "S Under this act , the minimum retirement age in Singapore is 62 years , thus allowing them to stay longer in the workforce .\n",
      "S This can be beneficial to them in several ways .\n",
      "S Firstly , they can accumulate more wealth through their work , which they can then use to support themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S Secondly , working provides them a good environment to maintain and even build up their physical and mental health .\n",
      "S This is possible through communication with their colleagues , which can help them to stay optimistic .\n",
      "S Thirdly , by working longer , they also help to ease the financial stress of their family members .\n",
      "S Another worry arising is the cost for health matters .\n",
      "S An ageing population with higher life expectancy is also associated with higher numbers of chronic and other medical conditions .\n",
      "S To help families in Singapore cope with the extensive treatment cost , the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports ( MCYS ) , has come up with services and programmes that provides affordable healthcare and eldercare services .\n",
      "S MCYS have both intermediate and long-term healthcare facilities .\n",
      "S Intermediate healthcare facilities include community hospitals , day rehabilitation centres for the elderly , and long-term healthcare facilities include hospices , home medical , nursing or therapy services and nursing homes .\n",
      "S These facilities mostly cater for families who have financial difficulties .\n",
      "S On the contrary , some Singaporeans have the mind set that these services and programmes are not of utmost importance to them as they each have their own medisave account to pay for their hospitalization bills .\n",
      "S Apart from this , some other Singaporeans might not think that later retirement is a good idea .\n",
      "S For example , companies might think that it is a more of a burden to hire an elderly worker , as they might not be able to cope with the stress and workload five .\n",
      "S There are also worries about the elderly workers ' health status .\n",
      "S Therefore , they would rather hire a worker with higher qualifications , who is more competent , and most importantly , younger .\n",
      "S However , little did they know that medisave account might be exhausted after a week .\n",
      "S Associate Professor Paulin Straughan said \" One hospitalization , for example , a stroke can set you back at tens of thousands of dollars .\n",
      "S Where are you going to get that money ?\n",
      "S \" ( Associate Professor Paulin Straughan , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , without the help and support from welfare organizations such as MCYS , majority of Singaporeans might not be able to handle high cost incurred for taking care of the elderly .\n",
      "S Also , when companies hire a worker , have they ever taken into consideration that experience does play a part in the working society ?\n",
      "S Without the past contributions from these elderly workers , these companies might not be able to stand wherever they are today .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is important that companies try to retain elderly workers , especially when the Singapore government do provide incentives for them when they do so .\n",
      "S Clearly , as our country is nearing the \" graying era \" , the importance of these policies and acts seems to be more obvious to all .\n",
      "S These can be seen from the willingness of people to stay longer in the workforce , and to people enrolling in the services and programmes provided by MCYS .\n",
      "S Ageing issues can be further eased if family members take the initiative to encourage their elderly members to stay longer in the workforce , so that they can contribute more to the society , help to ease household financial stress , accumulate more wealth , and also to stay healthier and wiser .\n",

      "S In the current context , public spending on the aged has been significant especially in the developed countries such as Singapore .\n",

      "S However , this spending on the aged is necessary but should be limited in order to have a balance spending between the aged and the country 's development such as infrastructure , education and skills upgrading .\n",

      "S However , as constructing is in progress , it often causes high pollution level and is unsightly .\n",
      "S But , the ultimate aim of investing expenditure on such a large scale project was to increase the standard of living of people .\n",
      "S Another instance could be the upgrading of roads to cater to the increasing amount of vehicles , to reduce road congestion .\n",
      "S It also facilitates the driving within Singapore by making it smoother and providing alternatives road which were lesser as compared to the past .\n",
      "S We may also have notice that our buildings are often undergoing maintenance and upgrading as it is part of the government scheme to maintain the condition of the building , minimizing the wear and tear after years and most importantly meant for the public to have a better environment to live in .\n",
      "S The above mentioned could be another area in which the government can divert their expenditure to .\n",
      "S Education is another area that the government should focus on as it aids in the development of the country .\n",
      "S The government can invest on having additional amenities in school such as gymnastics ; swimming pool ; and indoor sports hall as a form of relaxation , providing a conducive environment for the students .\n",
      "S Besides that , expenditure can be channeled in increasing the subsidies in education to encourage people to take up more studies , removing barrier due to insufficient cash flow .\n",
      "S As people are educated , they were able to contribute to the workforce in the near future .\n",
      "S Moreover , funds should also be diverted on providing skills upgrading for the workers for instance , a scheme such as \" Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience \" ( SPUR ) , which was introduce to improve and upgrade the worker 's skills .\n",
      "S The aim was to increase the employment rate by encouraging the retrenched people or the elderly to seize the opportunity to improve and upgrade themselves on the necessary and essential skills to continue in the workforce .\n",
      "S However at times , people may be reluctant to take up such programme which they perceive as useless .\n",
      "S As Peterson 's ( 2001 ) has stated , it is important for the elderly to have a later retirement to reduce elderly dependency .\n",
      "S This is the fact that as the elderly are employed , they were able to support themselves with their savings .\n",
      "S In order to achieve that , the elderly worker especially , must consistently upgrade themselves to keep up with the existing demands as employers are looking for the most cost effective resource for the organization .\n",
      "S Thus , this not only benefits the general public but as well as the aged .\n",
      "S In conclusion , although money spent on the elderly can ease the problem of aging population , it is only for a short term and is not a feasible solution .\n",
      "S It will only create a reliance on the government .\n",
      "S Therefore , we should take into consideration the effects that we will encounter in the long run .\n",
      "S By investing largely in the aged , other areas of developments for the country will be neglected which will result in more social problems .\n",
      "S Hence , spending on the aged should be restricted to a certain amount so that the resources in terms of financial can be divided equally based on the needs of the various sectors .\n",
      "S There should be a limitation for the public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S Over the years , the expenditure on the aged has relatively increased due to the shift to an aging population .\n",

      "S However , the increased health costs should not be depended solely by the government .\n",

      "S Demographic changes such as a growing population will have a serious consequence on health issues in developed countries .\n",
      "S National budgets and economies will come under pressure as growing numbers of elderly persons are supported by relatively fewer younger persons .\n",
      "S To deal with such challenges , governments have only two options , one of which is to reduce the future old-age dependency burden by increasing available resources .\n",
      "S This means coming up with policies that can increase the size and productivity of the current and next generation 's working-age population .\n",
      "S Alternatively , governments can reduce the amount of money spent on welfare benefits for the elderly .\n",
      "S Firstly , elderly dependency should be reduced by encouraging the elderly to retire later , and by lowering barriers to elder employment .\n",
      "S This can be achieved by increasing the eligibility age for public pensions and government incentives .\n",
      "S As people work longer , the amount of wealth generated would be greater .\n",

      "S However , as of today , the retirement age of Singaporeans has been increased to 62 , and that of Britain is expected to be increased to 68 by 2050 .\n",

      "S These measures would ensure that medical problems are treated early and more effectively , thus contributing to a healthier workforce and ultimately , a more productive labour force .\n",
      "S For example , in Singapore , citizens are encouraged to go for medical checkups every year and various medical benefits are provided so as to ensure that our workforce stays healthy and efficient .\n",

      "S Due to the advancement in technologies and the implementation of efficacy policies by the Singapore government , these have helped to alleviate the problems that are accompanied by the aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S Take for instance , in the past , due the lack of current research and developments available , most elderly who are diagnosed with illness were unlikely to recover and in most cases , they would have to stay in bad for the rest of their lives .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in the past , elderly especially spinsters and bachelors whom they have no family members to turn to in their old age often faced financial problems after they stopped working .\n",
      "S However , unlike the past , most elderly now are coping well with the aging process in terms of physically , economically and mentally .\n",
      "S As indicated in the statistics pertaining to the health status of the senior citizens ( as cited in the National Survey of Senior Citizens , 2005 ) , it stated that \" among senior citizens aged 55 and above , only 35.8 % reported a clean bill of health .\n",
      "S \" As such , it would seem that despite the great advancement in the area of medical technologies , a substantial percentage of the elderly are still suffering from medical ailments such as high blood pressure , bone or joint problems , diabetes and sight problems .\n",
      "S This may suggest that the current medical technologies have not help to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S On a closer look , although the present medical technologies may not be able to slow down the aging process , these technologies may help to prevent the medical ailments from occurring and also in some cases , alleviating the sufferings which the elderly has to go through .\n",
      "S For example , the invention of high blood pressure and diabetes monitors helped people especially the elderly to be more aware of and to be more able to monitor their own health conditions .\n",
      "S With proper medication , the 2 medical ailments would have a lower probability leading to kidney damage whereby the treatment for this illness would be more arduous than the common ailments .\n",
      "S As such , the advancement in medical technologies have shown to ease the aging process through the innovation of medical innovation which in turn aid the elderly in preventing common ailments exacerbating into serious illness whereby the treatments are more strenuous .\n",
      "S Although , in today 's context , around 66 % of the senior citizens aged 55 and above are provided with regular cash contributions from their children ( as stated in the National Survey of Senior Citizens , 2005 ) , there is still a significant number of senior citizens that faced financial difficulties in their old age , especially if these senior citizens are retired singles .\n",
      "S Hence , in order to aid the elderly through the aging process , the Singapore government has implemented several policies and measures to ensure that there is adequate protection for the elderly .\n",
      "S One good illustration would be the new CPF LIFE scheme ( Introduction to CPF life ) that will be launched in September 2009 .\n",
      "S Under this new scheme , it will offer members with a life-time income whereby the members will receive a sum of money monthly for as long as they live and the amount will depend on the cash savings they have in their Retirement Account .\n",
      "S Furthermore , besides ensuring that the elderly will have sufficient funds for their living expenses after their retirement , the Singapore government has also ensured that the elderly will be able to cope with the hefty and long term medical expenses in their old age through the implementation of policies such as the Eldershield ( Healthcare Financing , ElderShield ) .\n",
      "S As stated from the source , \" ElderShield is an affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who needs long-term care , especially during old age .\n",
      "S \" Thus , the elderly will be able to draw on the monthly payout to aid in paying for his or her long-term care expenses .\n",
      "S Hence , with the implementation of such policies , majority of the financial difficulties that the senior citizens faced in their old age would be alleviated .\n",
      "S The elderly would be able to rely on the monthly payouts from the various schemes to cope with their everyday lives even if they had stopped working .\n",
      "S Lastly , the grieving process ( Old Adult Mental Wellbeing , Health Promotion Board ) is part and parcel of the aging process whereby for the elderly , it is more common for them to lose their family members and friends in their old age and thus , this makes each single loss even more unbearable .\n",
      "S However , with the current developments and advanced medical help available , it would be able to aid in reducing the sufferings that the elderly would be experiencing during the grieving process .\n",
      "S The healing process will only start if the elderly are willing to seek and accept support from various sources .\n",
      "S For instance , one such facility development which the elderly would be able to seek help from would be the REACH Elderly Care Centre where the elderly would be able to receive day care , supervision and supportive help .\n",
      "S In addition , the place also serves to offer ample opportunities for the senior citizens to mingle with other people and take on meaningful activities so that they would be healthier in terms of both mentally and physically .\n",
      "S Furthermore , with the advancement in medical sciences , if the intensity of the grief does not fade off after a long period of time , the elderly can also seek professional help such as consulting the therapists and psychologists to assist them in getting over the grieving process .\n",
      "S As such , with the different types of facilities and medical developments available , the elderly no longer has to suffer in silence .\n",
      "S This further substantiates the fact that current research and development have indeed helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S It is ironic that how everybody wants to have long life expectancy but yet , no one wants to grow old .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , the aging process is commonly viewed as an unavoidable , undesirable , problem-ridden phrase of life that we are required to go through it .\n",
      "S However , with the advancement in technologies and implementation of effective policies , it has proved to be able to ease the aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S With the help of the technologies and policies , the elderly would definitely be able to manage their lives in their old age better .\n",

      "S However is this the correct attitude to hold towards the elderly ?\n",
      "S Should we hold back the aid for the aged who had contributed to the country 's success ?\n",
      "S That should n't be the case .\n",
      "S This essay will argue that public spending on the aged should not be limited to a large extent .\n",
      "S It will touch on the moral issues inherent and also argue that it is actually detrimental to a country 's future if its aged are not well taken care of , even if the money saved by limiting public spending on the elderly is spent developing other areas such as education and research and development .\n",
      "S At first glance , spending on education may seem to be more important than aiding the elderly as what we teach the youths will determine the future of the nation .\n",
      "S An education provides a platform for the youths to face the challenges in the future .\n",
      "S When faced with difficult decisions , the analytical skills learnt in school will help us to determine how to deal with these problems .\n",
      "S Hence , for small country such as Singapore which human resources is the key factor for the success , it is important that the citizen constantly upgrade themselves with the latest knowledge .\n",
      "S Therefore , government should devote more capital to ensure that the education system remain relevant in today 's dynamic global economy .\n",
      "S This certainly seems to be more important than pouring money down than on public spending on the elderly .\n",
      "S Some may say that it is more important that a country have an excellent research and development sector than healthy , happy senior citizens .\n",
      "S Research and development plays an important role in the innovation process which results in high quality products , successful businesses .\n",
      "S Research and development will very likely increase the levels of overseas investment as foreign multinational companies will see that country as a good place for business .\n",
      "S Therefore , with a strong research and development sector , a country will be more likely to succeed economically .\n",
      "S Again , public spending on research and development seems definitely to be more important than spending public money on the elderly .\n",
      "S After all , what can a group of healthy , well taken care of senior citizens bring to the country ?\n",
      "S Their knowledge has long become obsolete and there 's not much value they can bring to a country anymore .\n",
      "S However , is it really true that the elderly is irrelevant to a country 's development ?\n",
      "S This is not the case .\n",
      "S When the government provides sufficient money to look after the elderly , what is developed is the intangible moral value of gratitude and piety .\n",
      "S When a nation looks after their elderly without reservations , the lesson conveyed to its populace is that one should always look after the people who have contributed to our development .\n",
      "S As a result , what we learn then is to be grateful to the people who have aided us .\n",
      "S Such values are the essential element of the society .\n",
      "S It helps create strong lasting bonds between citizens and the result will be a more cohesive nation .\n",
      "S What about education and research and development ?\n",
      "S A strong education system and a strong research and development sector , when situated in a country that is not unified and chaotic will not be able to reap the benefits that they are supposed to generate .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending on the elderly does provide important benefits to the country and should not be limited thus .\n",
      "S Lastly , a country that does not take care of its elderly sufficiently runs the risk of having it younger population abandoning it and migrating to other countries .\n",
      "S No one would like to stay in a country with insufficient care for them in the future .\n",
      "S Majority of them would think that their hard work does not pay off .\n",
      "S They work so hard to contribute to this economy but the result turn out that the government do not provide sufficient care for them when they are old .\n",
      "S Hence , no more future leaders will be staying back to help the country to boost up the economy and run every sector .\n",
      "S This will turn the country into a gray society .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the elderly should still be invested in term of financial policies and benefits .\n",
      "S In conclusion , we should not see elderly as a burden but an asset .\n",
      "S Even thought other sectors such as education and research and development are important to us , we should not forget ours greatly contributors .\n",
      "S There are the ones who build up a nation from the basic to what we have now .\n",
      "S Therefore , we must be grateful to those who aided us and create a sense of belonging to everyone .\n",
      "S In this way , younger generation will then work harder for the nations in the future .\n",
      "S The baby boom in the 1960s and the current low fertility rate in Singapore has entrench Singapore into one of the fastest aging population in the world .\n",
      "S Living expenditure for the elderly is increased by the rising medical costs and standard of living .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is necessary for the government to review the public policies for the elderly .\n",
      "S Essentially , the expenditure used to finance medical and welfare programs should be proportionate to the larger aging population .\n",
      "S The people are the asset of Singapore and they have contributed to the country 's strong economic position .\n",
      "S As the population aged , it is the responsibility of the government to take care of its people .\n",
      "S Spending on the aged should not be limited .\n",
      "S The improvement in medical research has lengthened the life expectancy of the society .\n",
      "S However , the longer life span will inexplicitly incur a larger amount of long term health care expenses for the aged and the deterioration of physical mobility and communication might cause them to lose the ability to work and be self-sustained .\n",
      "S The situation is further worsened for a segment of the elderly in the society who is unmarried and inadequately educated .\n",
      "S They stand at the least advantageous position should there be a limitation in the public spending on the aged because they do not have families to depend on and the depletion in the marginal sum of savings will eventually result in social problems like starvation and homelessness .\n",
      "S Moreover , without the government 's support for the elderly , the burden of caring for these elderly will fall solely on the \" sandwich generation \" , whereby the individuals are to be financially responsible for their family , children and parents .\n",
      "S This is especially straining for individuals who are less financially well off .\n",
      "S In the long run , this financial responsibility may be too much for the working population to bear .\n",
      "S Hence , there is a need for the government to intervene by using part of the public funds to care for this aged population and ease the burden on the working population .\n",
      "S Singapore invested much of our public spending on the other areas of the country 's development like defence and economy .\n",
      "S Although these areas of development are necessary for the continual development of Singapore , we should not neglect the importance of public spending for the aged .\n",
      "S By providing more for the elderly and improvising health care polices , the government can actually improve the living conditions of the aged which will reduce possible social issues .\n",
      "S Furthermore , if the government can maintain social stability in its country , government may then focus on other aspects such as defence .\n",
      "S Ultimately , it is the responsibility of the working population and the government to take care of the elderly .\n",
      "S Other than taxation from the working population which is compulsory , it is necessary to garner support from the government to provide social welfare services , day-care centres , social support and improvisation of health systems .\n",
      "S Such coordination between the working population and government will benefit the aged who is concern with the provision of welfare from the state and this will give them a sense of security .\n",
      "S An ageing population is a worldwide pattern that is faced by all countries .\n",
      "S As the population is getting older this has social , political and economical impact on all societies .\n",
      "S Social impact would be that people would have to work harder because the proportion of people who are economically productive is not balance thus the younger generations has to be more productive to cater to the elderly low productivity .\n",
      "S An aging population will have a serious consequence on health issues in developed nations in the view that more medical support will be needed by the elderly .\n"

      "S Investing in the economic growth will reduce the stress of the younger generation as more jobs will be provided more employment with higher salary will be available to the working adults .\n",
      "S More businesses will start and more jobs will be created , which means more people will be employed thus more income tax which means more government funds to help support the elderly .\n",
      "S When more work is available , more people will be able earn and save more which means that the standard of living for the working people will improve and they will be able to support the elderly as they are more affluence .\n",
      "S Increase in economic growth will also mean that people are earning more thus there will be an increase in the taxable amount of the working people which this amount will be usable in providing better medical support to the elderly thus this will provide for both the working people in the sense that they will live better and the elderly in the sense that they will be supported with the proper amount of care .\n",
      "S Investing in technology in the sense of research and development will allow the discovery of new medical advancement as well as better facilities for medical cares .\n",

      "S New technology or medicine to prolonging and enhancing the quality of life will be available for the elderly and this will reduce the stress on the working force of the economy and in return increase in the productivity of the working force as they are more focus at work and they are able to provide and spend more time at work .\n",
      "S This means that there will be a better output of production thus more business and more income for a better economy .\n",
      "S This will allow for better economical growth for the country which in return gives more funding for the government to spend on the elderly as well .\n",
      "S Investing in social welfare of the working adults in the sense of providing better quality of life and better living standards will help to reduce stress on the working force so as to allow them to be more productive and capable to provide more for the elderly .\n",
      "S Some of the facilities provided by the Singapore Government was the provision of park connectors more facilities near working industries and central business district which allows working people to enjoy working and still have a good quality of life .\n",
      "S This helps to encourage working people to work and play better giving them a better standard of living .\n",
      "S In conclusion , Public spending on the aged should be limited and the money should be diverted to the other areas of the countries development like economic growth , research and development and the welfare of the people as this will allow more business , better facilities and encouragement for the people to be capable in supporting themselves and for their elderly parents , in the sense that the government is allowing the people to solve their own financial problem instead of providing of taking up their responsibilities which allows the government to invest and provide for other areas of the countries development .\n",
      "S Public spending has constantly been an issue in any nation .\n",
      "S Politicians and law-makers are often debating on how much money should be spent in each sector of the country .\n",
      "S With the rising number of elderly in an aging nation , the amount of money spent in this sector would increase as well .\n",
      "S However , there are other areas that require cash inflow to facilitate and push society forward .\n",
      "S Such areas include the military sector , security sector , education sector , research and development sector etc .\n",
      "S Thus , the government should not spend too much on the elderly and neglect the rest of society .\n",
      "S When one grows old , his body will be going through adjustments and soon , he will not be as fast or agile as he was before .\n",
      "S The government steps in and upgrades the environment more user-friendly which includes , more handrails along steps and stairs , longer gentle slopes around the housing estates , upgrading of lifts to every floor in older flats , having more elder friendly lifts , etc .\n",
      "S Elderly become more vulnerable to illnesses and diseases as they age and it would take a much longer time to recover , unlike their younger days .\n",
      "S Together with rising medical costs and inflation , this would pose as a problem for the aged , even if one had prepared an amount of savings for his golden years .\n",
      "S The government would get involved once again and provide subsidies for the elderly in medical bills and as such .\n",
      "S Terrorism is a growing threat today as it is getting more complicated to understand the terrorists and counter or prevent them .\n",
      "S Constant vigilance against them will take a toll on the civil service sector such as the police and civil defense .\n",
      "S More research and studies would have to be done to learn about them , their thinking and their actions and how one should be prepared against them .\n",
      "S As the terrorism spreads and complicates their attacks , from bombing the Twin Towers in United States of America ( NYDailyNews , September 11 attacks ) to the Mumbai attacks ( Mail Online , Mumbai terror attack gunman admits guilt in dramatic courtroom confession ) , one could see that terrorism is growing and it is becoming much tougher to counter them in the future .\n",
      "S Other than relying on the police and military forces , the government has to educate the public on the dangers of terrorism and the importance in preventive them .\n",

      "S Government spending has been growing each year in the education sector .\n",
      "S This is due to incurring costs from the needs for teachers to the maintenance of a conducive and cohesive environment for the student and providing subsidized education for the public .\n",
      "S Such costs do not stop once the child leaves the secondary school .\n",

      "S Such courses and workshops are relatively expensive to conduct and thus , the government 's efforts to subside them are to encourage more workers to attend and upgrade themselves .\n",
      "S This could also keep the older generation longer in the economy so as to provide for themselves for more years to come , instead of relying on the government , in turn , reducing the need to elderly spending .\n",

      "S As shown , preventive measures against terrorism is a cost effective way to counter them instead of dealing with the aftermath .\n",

      "S Singapore was ranked third for the highest life expectancy in the world , such that an aging population is evident .\n",
      "S Before taking effective actions , leaders must first realise that any further expansion of retirement benefits would only impoverish future generations and limit future public spending ( Peterson , P.G .\n",
      "S ( 2001 ) ) .\n",
      "S As such , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas like Ministry of Finance , Education , Health and National Development .\n",
      "S Each area must not be neglected , as they have significant contribution to aid in taking care of the aging population .\n",
      "S Firstly , for Ministry of Finance ( 2009 ) in Singapore , funds must be pumped into the economy to ensure solvency of the country .\n",
      "S For instance , Monetary Authority of Singapore ( MAS ) and Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ( IRAS ) are established to make sure that entities operating within Singapore 's authority are attuned to the international standards and practices .\n",
      "S All these statutory boards and institutions require funds to run their operations to ensure Singapore 's competitiveness , such that revenue earned can be allocated to other ministries ' operation and policies usage .\n",
      "S Secondly , for Ministry of Education ( 2009 ) in Singapore , funds must be invested in educational institutions and policies .\n",
      "S For example , funds are needed to build good infrastructure and facilities for scholastic purposes such that their education is received under good environment .\n",
      "S After all , the younger generations are the futures of Singapore who will soon be the ones taking care of the aged .\n",
      "S Funds are also needed to draw effective educational programs to ensure that the young are equipped with fine skills to cope with the metropolitan society in Singapore after leaving the institutions .\n",
      "S In this society , funds are also needed to draw programs to educate the young on the moral values ; where moral values are the corner stone of an individual 's character and personality .\n",
      "S Thirdly , for Ministry of Health ( 2009 ) in Singapore , funds are needed to ensure that the rising demand of healthcare services for the general public is met .\n",
      "S For example , as mentioned by our Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ( National Day Rally Speech , 2009 ) , hospitals like Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital will be built to meet the rising demand and at the same time providing accessibility .\n",
      "S Funds from the government are also needed to aid the voluntary welfare organizations .\n",
      "S This measure is needed so as to free out the beds in the general hospital , so that more acute cases of patients could be taken care of and the milder cases can recuperate in a community level with their families and familiar surroundings , in turn it is also a cheaper alternative for the patients to cope with the rising healthcare cost .\n",
      "S However , if public spending on the aged is not limited , more financial aid could be given to them , and in turn lessen the burden of the younger generation to provide for the elderly .\n",
      "S At the same time , the aged will feel more valued by the nation when they are being cared for .\n",
      "S Lastly , for Ministry of National Development ( 2009 ) in Singapore , funds are needed to develop housing policies to take care of the population and build national parks , neighbourhood parks and greeneries .\n",
      "S For the former , housing grants , subsidies , CPF schemes are used to ensure affordability of having a decent roof for the public .\n",
      "S Funds are also needed to build handicap facilities , for instance ramps and Lift Upgrading Program ( LUP ) .\n",
      "S For the latter it is especially important for the public as they can have a place for leisure .\n",
      "S It could be a place for all the residents in the neighbourhood to come together to interact , exercise and forge friendship .\n",
      "S This would help prevent them from experiencing loneliness and also a channel for the residents to communicate and help each other in times of need .\n",
      "S Therefore , after considering all the factors , I agree that public spending on the aged should be limited as other factors are equally important in taking care of the public , ensuring international competiveness and progress for the nation .\n",
      "S Each factor has its own way of contributing to the society as a whole and the elderly will benefit directly or indirectly from the development as well .\n",
      "S Public spending must be cost effective to ensure a steady rate of return from its investments to allow the country to develop and prosper .\n",
      "S Sufficient public funds are needed to develop different area of the country in terms of social , economical , defence and government administration .\n",
      "S To ensure that there are sufficient funds for the country 's development , public spending on the age should be limited .\n",
      "S In order for the country to develop , funds are needed for investment in retraining of workers , expanding of economic structure and maintaining a high standard of education in various educational institutions .\n",
      "S Firstly funds are needed to invest in retraining of workers .\n",
      "S Due to globalization , training of workers is important to develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce .\n",
      "S The Singapore Budget ( 2009 ) reported that the government will be spending $ 457.7 million of the public fund to subsidise training programmes for working Singaporeans .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the Ministry of Manpower and Workforce Development Agency had developed a program , which is called Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience , SPUR , in providing training courses at subsidies rate for people to attend .\n",
      "S Apart from working population to be re-skilled , the SPUR programme helps retrenched workers to learn new skills so that they can be reemployed and companies are able to send their personnel for training which helps to reduce retrenchments .\n",
      "S However , there are some older workers whom are unable to attend any courses despite being offered at subsides rate .\n",
      "S Dr Isa Hassan identified three factors on why older workers are not attending any courses .\n",
      "S Firstly , some older workers have weak command of English or are English illiterate as they are school dropouts .\n",
      "S This has discourages them from attending the training course as it is conducted in English .\n",
      "S Secondly , older workers have little time to attend training courses .\n",
      "S Some older workers are earning minimal wages thus they have to take a second job or part time job to boost their income earning .\n",
      "S Lastly the older workers have negative mindset of going back to school to be re-skilled .\n",
      "S Some older workers may feel embarrass or dislike going back to school at an old age .\n",
      "S Therefore to develop and maintain a highly skilled workforce , workers have to go for training courses to be re-skilled and retrenched workers have to learn new skills to be reemployed .\n",
      "S Secondly government expenditure is needed to expand and maintain economic structure .\n",
      "S The Singapore Budget ( 2009 ) has reported that the Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Trade and Industry will be spending a total of $ 4624.83 million on expanding the road network , railway network and developing industrial infrastructure in Singapore .\n",
      "S With having an excellent economic infrastructure like efficient transportation network and fully furnished workplace , will attract foreign investors thus making the country to be an industry hub .\n",
      "S The Economic Development Board article ( 2009 ) mentioned in 2007 World Bank reported that Singapore had earned the top position of having a top logistic hub in the world .\n",
      "S As a result , the country is able to maintain their economic competitive edge , as well as create more jobs for the people and enjoy higher standard of living .\n",
      "S Lastly public spending are required to maintain high standard of education in various educational institutions .\n",
      "S A high standard of education is an important factor of maintaining a highly educated workforce in the country .\n",
      "S Investing in education is like investing in the future so the future generations are able to meet future challenges .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the government invests heavily on education through subsidising school fees of schools and post-secondary education institution .\n",
      "S In the Singapore Budget ( 2009 ) , the Ministry of Education is investing $ 7,884 million into subsidising school fees .\n",
      "S This is to ensure that school fees are affordable and allowing every citizen to receive a proper education .\n"

      "S Over the years , the problem of a rapidly aging population is becoming prominent and an area of concern for many countries .\n",
      "S Consequently , economic growth would be affected and many societal issues would surface .\n",
      "S Moreover , a fast aging population would inevitably increase the amount of government expenditure on healthcare and welfare programmes .\n",
      "S Although governments ought to provide financial assistance for the elderly , spending on other sectors of the country should not be neglected .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited as funds should also cater to other areas of development such as education , training programmes , and even national defence .\n",
      "S Firstly , investment in education is vital in promoting economic growth .\n",
      "S Moreover , it prepares oneself to think independently and logically .\n",
      "S Through education , individuals are armed with the necessary skills and knowledge which would increase their productivity and competitiveness in the labour market .\n",
      "S The process of gaining knowledge is of paramount importance in developing countries as it would reduce the level of poverty and increase their ability to find quality jobs .\n",
      "S In this way , wealth would be generated and the economy would improve as their employability increases .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , it could be argued that the benefit of education in elevating economic growth is still unapparent .\n",
      "S There is no one type of education that is suitable for all societies .\n",
      "S Joshua ( 2001 ) also mentioned that it is unclear which type of education would lead to a higher economic growth .\n",
      "S Yet , one can not deny the fact that a shortfall in educated people would restrict economic expansion .\n",
      "S Thus , it is crucial for countries to invest in the form of education that is desirable for its people to ensure greater economic development .\n",
      "S Secondly , countries should also focus on providing financial aid for trainings and seminars to be conducted for the working population .\n",
      "S Through the process of upgrading , individuals are empowered with the relevant skills and knowledge demanded by the job market .\n",
      "S For instance , the National Trade Union Congress ( NTUC ) , of Singapore ( 2001-2009 ) has been active in providing trainings for jobholders to upgrade their skills and knowledge .\n",
      "S In this way , they would have the proficiency to deal with any problems that may arise .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , it could be refuted that this might promote job hoping .\n",
      "S With the new skills and knowledge obtained , individuals would hunt for better paying and quality jobs .\n",
      "S Ilana ( 2001 ) claimed that people who possessed the essential skills would change occupations due to the lucrative salary offered by different companies .\n",
      "S However , funding of training programmes should still proceed as it would increase the productivity and capability of the working population in handling any challenges there might surface in the future .\n",
      "S Lastly , funding on national security should not be ignored .\n",
      "S A strong military defence helps to deter any possible threats and dangers that may occur .\n",
      "S This is of great importance in today 's context where terrorism is becoming prominent .\n",
      "S In recent time , terrorists have accessed to sophisticated technologies that could create greater destruction to the surrounding and to instil fear in the people .\n",
      "S Hence , organisations and agencies related to national defence ought to receive adequate financial assistance for research and development .\n",
      "S In this way , military forces would then be armed with the latest equipment which is crucial to maintain their fighting capabilities .\n",
      "S For example , Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( 2000 ) stated that 13 million dollars are spent on national security yearly even though it places an immense pressure on the federal budget .\n",
      "S Therefore , continuous support on national defence is deemed important to ensure peace and harmony within the society .\n",
      "S In conclusion , nations should be careful in deciding the amount of spending on each area of development .\n",
      "S Expenditure should not be spent solely on the elderly as it would hinder the growth of other areas like education , trainings and national security .\n",
      "S Policy makers should realise and recognise that it is through careful planning and a combination of effective policies that would allow the nations to grow and flourish .\n",
      "S Aging population is a worldwide situation which will affect all countries in the world at different intensities and speed ( United Nations [ UN ] , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S This process is experienced by the developed countries at first but now the developing countries as well and it is especially rapid in this twenty-first century ( UN , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S As the proportion of elder persons in the world continues to increase , there is a need for the government to intervene as there will be many elderly who can not support themselves .\n",
      "S Thus , the government needs to come up with policies to help them .\n",
      "S If this public spending on the elderly is not limited , it might have an impact on the countries in terms of national budgets and economies .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should be limited so that economic growth can be sustained , societal problems faced by the communities can be solved and other essential policies can be sustained .\n",
      "S By limiting public spending on the aged , some spending can be used to sustain economic growth , which is a key factor to the prosperity of a country .\n",
      "S According to Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer ( 2005 ) , \" small differences in sustained economic growth will have a dramatic impact on the fiscal future of society .\n",
      "S \" With little economic growth , society is limited in its ways to assist those who require assistance .\n",
      "S In contrast , with adequate economic growth , more can be done to help the people in need .\n",
      "S This is because people will have more spare money to help the needy and government will not need to increase taxations .\n",
      "S In addition , once economic growth is stable , there will be prosperity and employment rate will decrease .\n",
      "S The number of people in need of assistance will thus decrease .\n",
      "S Hence , it is crucial for a country to limit public spending on the aged and focus on economic growth so that there can be prosperity .\n",
      "S If public spending on the aged is not limited , the government will not be able to solve problems faced by society .\n",
      "S Many countries face problems such as housing , transportation and education ( Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Policies will need to be introduced and thus will increase expenditures of the government .\n",
      "S This will increase the burden of the present and future working generations .\n",
      "S Through cutting down some spending on the aged , the funds can be used in solving problems faced by society and help to relieve the pressure faced by the current working force to support the elderly .\n",
      "S The government should channel its spending to sustain policies which are vital for the country .\n",
      "S It will need to focus on areas such as education and reducing elder dependency of the current elder generation .\n",
      "S With higher education , the future generations of working people tend to have higher incomes and thus can accumulate more wealth for future use when they are old ( Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S The government can also lower barriers to elder employment and stressing filial obligation ( Robert B. Friedland and Laura Summer , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S However , all these policies might not necessarily produce the desired results .\n",
      "S For example , though the government gives subsidies to companies to urge them to employ older workers , there may not be many who have the necessary skills .\n",
      "S The government will need to spend some money on retraining the elderly to equip them with the necessary skills for the job .\n",
      "S Thus , the government will need to be flexible in altering its policies .\n",
      "S Though there may be uncertainties that positive results will be yielded , it is still important to limit public spending on the aged so that some money can still be diverted to other important areas .\n"

      "S As more countries are facing the problem of an aging population , it is important to limit public spending on the aged so as to sustain economic growth , solve problems of the communities and support necessary policies for the country .\n",
      "S Different countries will need to have different solutions specially tailored to fit their own countries and public spending should be split evenly so that there is a balance in each area .\n",
      "S Presently , existing policies have helped Singapore extensively in providing ease to the foreseen aging crisis .\n",
      "S To achieve successful ageing , the government has implemented various policies to be well prepared in her golden years .\n",
      "S Firstly , in order to cope with the drastic fall in fertility rate , the government has encouraged Singaporeans to marry and procreate , and at the same time attract foreigners into our society .\n",
      "S Additionally , the government has also introduced a Marriage and Parenthood Package which includes bigger baby bonus , longer maternity leave , as well as increased subsidies at childcare centres to boost her population .\n",
      "S Unfortunately , these schemes did not seem to appeal to the vast majority as the birth rate still remains stagnant .\n",
      "S The next most apparent concerned is the need to ensure one 's financial security during old age , either through retirement savings or an extension of employment years .\n",
      "S The government has implemented lifelong financial policy like the Central Provident Fund to prepare her people in planning and saving ahead for the ageing crisis .\n",
      "S Despite adopting the Central Provident Fund system , statistics has proven that only one in three Singaporeans are financially prepared .\n",
      "S Certainly , this statistics proved that not the entire nation is ready .\n",
      "S Therefore , it would only be wise if there are appropriate modifications made to the CPF scheme .\n",
      "S In recent years , awareness on the extension of employment years has also been promoted .\n",
      "S The society today has widened their perspective in employing aged workers and hence encouraged them to continue working even when they reached their retirement age .\n",
      "S A latest survey confirmed that most Singaporean companies agreed that retirement of older worker will be a great loss of valuable skills and knowledge .\n",
      "S Therefore , having an ageing workforce might not necessary be negative .\n",
      "S Elderly workers can also provide mentorship for the younger employees , imparting and sharing their valuable knowledge and past working experiences .\n",
      "S In an ageing society , the social aspects not only include the need for appropriate housing schemes but also health care systems for present and future generation of elderly .\n",
      "S An elderly-friendly built environment is a key principle to which an elderly can adjust and integrate themselves into the community .\n",
      "S For instance , accessible infrastructure provides a safe and comfortable environment for the elderly to recuperate their old age .\n",
      "S Indirectly , it also helps to maintain social network and allows them to participate in social activities .\n",
      "S Hence , The Housing Development Board has customised studio apartments equipped with elder-friendly fittings and features .\n",
      "S In addition , the lift upgrading programme was introduced to allow lifts to be provided at every level of high-rise HDB blocks for the convenience of the elderly .\n",
      "S Furthermore , other facelift programs in the older estates include ramps for wheelchair accessibility , fitness corner and covered walkways .\n",
      "S Hence , with these schemes , it is proven that elderly in Singapore are given top priority in the community .\n",
      "S Last but not least , to ensure that basic healthcare is affordable to all Singaporeans , Singapore has prepared her people with MediShield , MediSave and MediFund .\n",
      "S This is done by putting safety nets to ensure that healthcare remains affordable .\n",
      "S Besides , the government has decided to build more hospitals to cope with higher demands in the future .\n",
      "S Hence , with the multi-dimensional approach taken by the government , Singaporeans are able to enjoy quality healthcare services .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the government has done well to prepare the country for ageing population in the aspects of economy , social and population growth .\n",
      "S However , to allow ageing policies to be truly successful for the future generation , it should be reviewed and remodelled when necessary .\n",
      "S The society should also maintain a positive and mature attitude towards ageing population .\n",
      "S Most importantly , individuals should be responsible and self-reliant to take up ownership of the ageing issue .\n",
      "S Public spending has been increasing in many countries over the years .\n",
      "S With the world population ageing , many developed countries are trying to cope with high expenditure on the elderly .\n",
      "S However , there is a need to limit public spending on the elderly for the benefit of the country .\n",
      "S In the long run , investing in other areas would help to ease the problem of high expenditure on the elderly .\n",
      "S These funds needs to be diverted to other areas of development as it would help to improve the economy , benefit the younger generation and increase employment rate .\n",
      "S A nation needs a strong economy to support its expenditure .\n",
      "S A weak economy would have difficulty to divide its funds among the different areas .\n",
      "S Needless to say , the nation would have problem to support the increasing spending on the elderly in a bearish economy .\n",
      "S Hence , a strong economy would allow the nation to set aside more funds for the elderly .\n",
      "S Limiting the public spending on the elderly is only temporary .\n",
      "S This solution will benefit everyone in the long term .\n",
      "S Thus it is important for the nation to divert our public spending to with the aim of improve the economy .\n",
      "S Just like elderly is an important asset to a nation , children is an also important asset .\n",
      "S The nation can benefit the younger generation by diverting its fund on other areas .\n",
      "S Hoover ( Lewis , 2009 ) , 31st President of the United States , once said , \" Children are our most valuable natural resource \" .\n",
      "S Prof Ho ( 2007 ) also pointed out that children , being the future of a nation , are the most important asset .\n",
      "S This means that there is need to start early on each child 's development .\n",
      "S The nation has great responsibility to help in developing the children 's potential .\n",
      "S They will be the ones that will bring the nation to a greater height .\n",
      "S Therefore , funds should be diverted to assist on child 's development .\n",
      "S There is another reason why public funding on the elderly should be limited .\n",
      "S A nation need to ensure the workforce is well trained to remain competitive .\n",
      "S Many countries , such as Denmark and Singapore , have started to retrain their workers ( Onn , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S The workforce is the driving force that improves the economy of a country .\n",
      "S Since the economy affects how much funding a nation can spend on the elderly , it is important to ensure that the workforce receives enough training to improve the economy .\n",
      "S However , people should not rely on its government to provide funds for training .\n",
      "S The responsibility lies on the individual who wants to keep his rice bowl .\n",
      "S These people should spend more money on training to assist their future career .\n",
      "S But there is a need to remember that not all people can fully support themselves for training program .\n",
      "S As a result , the government should still provide basic incentives to aid people to remain competitive in the industry .\n",
      "S The three reasons provided explained why public funds on elderly should be limited and divert to other areas of development .\n",
      "S These areas will affect how much a nation can support its aging population .\n",
      "S Although the elderly are an important asset , but they are not the only asset a nation has .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the nation needs to sacrifice the elderly temporarily for the benefit of everyone .\n",
      "S By diverting the resources to develop on other areas , the elderly will benefit more in the future .\n",
      "S The nation must not be short sighted and seek to solve problems of an ageing population only .\n",
      "S Policymakers should think of how the nation can solve the ageing population in the process of developing plans that will benefit the other areas .\n",
      "S To achieve this , we need to remember this ; assisting the elderly is important but building a nation is more important .\n",
      "S In the developed countries , many countries are facing the problems of fast ageing population .\n",

      "S During their contribution to the working world , the aged should be able to plan ahead in advance for their future on the likely cost incurred for health care services .\n",
      "S If public spending is not limited , the aged or the working people may take the aids provided by the government for granted thus they may not work hard during their contribution to the working world .\n",

      "S One factor which contributes largely to the economy of a country is the tourism industry ; this is supported by Rachael Kelly ( 2009 ) .\n",

      "S Limiting public spending on the aged should be done so for the favours of other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Besides taking care for the aged , there are several other areas the government should put the same amount of emphasis on when dividing how much each sector should get from the national budget .\n",
      "S This includes the country 's economy , transport system and infrastructure , public housing , recreational facilities and more .\n",
      "S Moreover , the government should calculate the benefits over cost for the money invested .\n",
      "S One of the most important areas the government should invest their money on is economic growth .\n",
      "S The benefits of economic growth is not only current , it is far-fetched .\n",
      "S Employment , national stability , economic stability and power are just some of the benefits that come with economic growth .\n",
      "S With regards to tending to the aged , economic growth may restrict some of the current plans the government may have , but in the future , the government will have more say and economic power to do more for the aged .\n",
      "S The next area the government should pay more attention on is the current economic and social issues that exist at that time .\n",
      "S For example , in times of an economic recession like now , the government should pump in more money to revive the economy , like the upgrading of lifts throughout the island .\n",
      "S Not only does it bring employment , it boosts business and trade .\n",
      "S These current issues should be dealt promptly .\n",
      "S Without prompt actions , the matter may worsen and if not dealt with properly , the consequence is catastrophic .\n",
      "S Hence , it is important for the government to rank the severity of the issues and deal with them accordingly .\n",
      "S As for the aged , although we can not neglect them , but we can always provide them with just the right amount so that they will too get what they deserve from the society .\n",
      "S The third argument takes the sentiments of the working class into consideration .\n",
      "S Making the working class pay more taxes to finance the needs of the aged will cause resentment amongst the working class .\n",
      "S Prolonged resentment is unhealthy for the society and it may cause social problems like strikes and protests , to name a few .\n",
      "S Therefore the government have to strike a balance and find the equilibrium whereby the amount of tax is reasonable and enough for comfortable usage .\n"

      "S However , some may argue that public spending on the aged should n't be limited .\n",
      "S This is because the aged are the most vulnerable group of people in the society .\n",
      "S Age usually comes with illness and disabilities , like wheelchair bound and the need for healthcare for their illnesses .\n",
      "S They require the highest amount of attention and care .\n",
      "S Limiting spending on the aged will deprive them from the basic aids they require for survival .\n",
      "S Inhumane actions like neglecting the aged will be slammed by the public , especially those with special sympathy for the old .\n",
      "S Since there is a need for other areas of the country 's development to receive the money and at the same time not neglecting the aged , a compromise must be reached .\n",
      "S The best solution to compromise both parties would be spending the minimum that provides the aged with the most basic facilities to meet their needs .\n",
      "S It would thus accommodate both parties , ideally reaching equilibrium .\n",
      "S In conclusion , there are so many other issues of the society the government has to consider other than the aging population .\n",
      "S These issues have similar , if not higher importance , as compared to the aged .\n",
      "S The government should always measure the economic and social benefits and costs before implementing any policies , and implement those with the highest benefits .\n",
      "S But the question is : Will the government be firm enough to make the harsh decision ?\n",
      "S As people grow older , our health will gradually deteriorates and we will no longer be able to work and support ourselves after retirement .\n",
      "S Hence , public spending from the government is needed to provide the elderly with a comfortable environment to enjoy their retired lives .\n",
      "S Some examples of government 's spending on the aged in Singapore include healthcare benefits like the ElderShield and lift upgrading programme in HDB to provide an environment which is friendlier to the elderly .\n",
      "S We need to recognize that public spending on the aged should be limited so that money could be diverted to other areas of country 's development to attain higher efficiency and to have better allocation of resources .\n",
      "S Apart from that , it should be limited to instill the importance of being independent and prevent over-reliance on the government .\n",
      "S Firstly , public spending on the aged should be limited to ensure higher efficiency in government 's expenditure and to have better allocation of resources .\n",
      "S This is because it is only entitled to the elderly , excluding the rest of the population who are not eligible .\n",
      "S By limiting government 's spending on the aged and diverting them to development on other areas , we are not just targeting on the elder population but the entire population instead .\n",
      "S One example is by transferring the money that we can use solely on the aged to other field of country 's development like improvement in infrastructure .\n",
      "S This will benefit the whole population including the aged through providing a more diverse and well-developed system in transport , like the construction of the new circle lines in Singapore .\n",
      "S One may say that development in other areas may exclude some of the elderly from the benefits due to their low levels of education and access .\n",
      "S However , we can always organize campaigns to educate our elder population to direct them to enjoy these benefits , allowing the government to limit their expenditure on the aged .\n",
      "S Secondly , to allow our population to realize the importance of being independent and to prevent over-reliance on the government , we should limit public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S This is to prevent the common misconception that the elderly can rely on the government to support them during old age .\n",
      "S As seen from past experience from other countries , over-dependence on the government would dampen the country 's economy , for example , the failure of welfare state in Britain .\n",
      "S In order to help the population to be independent and to save for old age , the government has established the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) Board .\n",
      "S \" CPF is a comprehensive social security savings plans that has provided many working Singaporeans with a sense of security and confidence in their old age .\n",
      "S \" ( CPF Board , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S At this point , one may wonder if the government were to limit public spending on the aged , it will lead to higher burden on the rest of the family , perpetuating more social problems like family violence .\n",
      "S Even with the setting up of the CPF account , it will not help to solve the problem because the amount of income earned by the working population will still remain the same .\n",
      "S Therefore , one way to counter this problem is through diverting the money to other field of country 's development like education .\n",
      "S By investing more money in education , we will be able to produce a future generation which is more affluent and productive , ensuring economic stability and thus generating higher income .\n",
      "S Only then we can increase our capability and independence to support the aged and thus it is wise to limit public spending .\n",
      "S In conclusion , we should limit public spending on the aged in order to ensure that we can be more efficient and ensure that there is better allocation of resources by developing areas that can benefit the entire population .\n",
      "S Also , the government can implement more policies to allow the population to be more independent and increase the awareness of preparing for old age .\n",
      "S Most importantly , the government should divide public spending equally according to the different needs of the various areas of country 's development .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited to maintain the standard of living of the aged and to reach out to those who are in need of financial aid .\n",
      "S \" In Singapore , factors such as a relatively low birth rate and high-quality health care , which helps people live longer , contribute to the ageing population .\n",
      "S \" , quoted by Mr. Lee ( Lee , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Aging population is defined as having more elderly compared to the younger generations .\n",
      "S Some of the reasons for an aging population are caused by low birth rate and low mortality rate .\n",
      "S Even though an aging population will slow down the growth and economy of the future society , it will not be long term .\n",
      "S Thus , public spending for the aged should still be budgeted and focused on other areas of development which will help generate more income .\n",
      "S By setting a budget on public spending for the aged , the government can develop in areas such as building infrastructures , attracting foreign investors , improving education system , and expanding the research and development of defence technology .\n",
      "S Firstly , with limited money spent on the aged , the government can build more infrastructures to attract foreign companies to set up businesses in Singapore .\n",
      "S Singapore being a safe country with no natural disaster and previous records of terrorism , foreign investors will feel safer in setting up their businesses here .\n",
      "S Having more foreign investments implies an increase in foreign exchange as foreign currency grows and this would bring in additional revenue for the country .\n",
      "S At the same time , it also increases government tax as more people are working .\n",
      "S Furthermore , increasing foreign investors would result in more job creations .\n",
      "S With the increase in employment rates , the standard of living will improve and people will have more money for retirement .\n",
      "S However , there will be a risk that the revenue generated by the foreign investors will be returned to their own country .\n",
      "S This result in a loss of revenue and it will slow down the rate of return of investment for the government .\n",
      "S Even so , in the long run , the government will eventually get back what they have invested on building the infrastructure and the locals will still have a job which prepares them for their retirement .\n",
      "S Secondly , with lesser money spent on the aged , the government can improve the education system in Singapore for the younger generation .\n",
      "S This category of people requires more attention and funds from the government as compared to the aged , as they are the future ambassadors of Singapore .\n",
      "S The future growth and development of Singapore is depended on them .\n",
      "S At the same time , by better educating the future generations of Singapore , they will be able to secure a better paying job in the future , which they will be able to support themselves as well as their aged parents .\n",
      "S Thus , by improving the education system , the children will be better educated and less dependent on the government for any form of subsidiaries for themselves or their aged parents .\n",
      "S Last but not least , the government can use the money to expand on the research and development of the defence technology .\n"

      "S With better defence technology , the government need not spend money on buying defence weapons from other countries and instead , earn they can earn revenue by selling their own weapons .\n",
      "S By limiting the public spending on the aged and using it on defence technology research , Singapore will be better equipped in safeguarding itself as well as earning additional revenue for the country .\n",
      "S At the same time , an expansion in the research and development of the defence technology will demand more manpower .\n",
      "S As a result , more jobs opportunities will be available for not just the future generations , but as well as the elderly .\n",
      "S Limiting the public spending on the aged opens up other areas for development such as infrastructure , education and defence .\n",
      "S These developments will improve the lives of the current and future generation and in the long run , dependency of the future generations when they are old will be minimal as they will most likely have sufficient money for retirement .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending for the aged should be limited and focused on developing other areas .\n",
      "S A Better Aging Society\n",
      "S Global aging is a critical topic that the world has been concerned about .\n",
      "S While societies are confronted with the many unprecedented consequences of an aging population , such problems will continue to persist , if not worsen if nothing is done to reduce the impact of aging .\n",
      "S Fortunately , various initiatives and policies have been put in place to alleviate the effects of the aging process .\n",
      "S These programmes and policies are targeted at addressing 3 main aging issues : physical and mental health of elderly , employability of older workers and financial burden on the older and younger generation .\n",
      "S Promoting Healthy Lifestyle\n",
      "S While the government focuses its expenditure on improving healthcare products and treatments , it is also important that elderly maintain a healthy lifestyle .\n",
      "S Leading an active and healthy lifestyle helps to reduce chances of getting aging related health problems such as lower stamina , rheumatism , falling memory , senile dementia , and emotional setbacks .\n",
      "S Currently , various programmes have been implemented by the government to promote healthy lifestyle in older people .\n",
      "S For example in Singapore , the government introduce a 2 years wellness programme that aims to encourage healthy lifestyle by catering the physical , social and emotional needs of seniors through health screenings , social services , exercises , eldercare and social networking sessions ( Lim , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S By maintaining a socially active lifestyle , elderly are more resistance to health problems as they are able to keep both their mind and body active and healthy .\n",
      "S The 3 R 's of Elder Employment\n",
      "S Encouraging elderly to support themselves in their old age by extending their working life helps to reduce elder dependency ( Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S In support of this , policymakers have put in place various measures and policies to govern the employment practices of older workers .\n",
      "S These measures oversee that employment of older workers should be based on 3 R 's of employment namely : Recruitment of workers aged 40 and above , Retention of existing workers aged 55 to 61 and Re-employment of existing workers aged 62 and above ( NTUC Online , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S The practice of 3 R 's can be commonly seen in Singapore where it has recently raised the retirement age from 62 to 65 years old and above .\n",
      "S In complement with its re-employment legislation , the government has also enacted other legislations and initiatives for instance the Tripartite Committee on Employability of Older Workers and Advantage !\n",
      "S Scheme .\n",
      "S However , elder discrimination is not a problem that can be resolve instantaneously .\n",
      "S Most companies are still discriminating against employing older workers as they can hire younger workers who are better educated and more productive .\n",
      "S Therefore , the 3R 's employment practices would aim to lighten the discrimination by resolving most companies ' unwilling rationale ( i.e .\n",
      "S limited resource and additional financial cost ) in employing older workers .\n",
      "S Hong Kong has also adopted such practices through its 4 yours CADENZA Community Project which seeks to create an \" Elder-Friendly Employment Practice \" such as job design , flexible working hours and friendly physical environment ( CADENZA Community Project : Elder-Friendly Employment Practice , n.d. ) .\n",
      "S This strategy of longer employment seems to be a highly feasible and accepted solution in tackling global aging .\n",
      "S Spread of Financial Burden\n",
      "S Policymakers have also step up efforts in reducing the financial burden of an aging population by providing financial aids and encouraging people to save in advance for their retirement .\n",
      "S Medisave , Medishield and Medifund Sliver are some examples of medical schemes introduced in Singapore to lighten the medical cost burden of its senior citizens .\n",
      "S In addition , the state enforces its main retirement saving scheme , the Central Provident Fund Saving ( CPF ) whereby individuals are oblige to contribute a fix percentage of their monthly salary to their CPF account when they are employed .\n",
      "S In this way , the people are indirectly saving for their old age .\n",
      "S Unity is the Best Strategy\n",
      "S Aging population is a global phenomenon that affects everyone .\n",
      "S With the development of various policies and strategies , leaders must understand that the best strategy is one where everyone unites together in conquering the long term battle of global aging .\n",
      "S They need to recognize that the effectiveness of any strategies will depend on every individual involvement .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , leaders should continue to revise current policies and develop new strategies so as to better prepare and tackle harsher challenges ahead .\n",
      "S It is inevitable that public spending will significantly increase with the aging population .\n",
      "S More money has to be diverted to healthcare , pensions and elderly-friendly infrastructure to cater to the needs of the aged .\n",
      "S For instance , it is projected that between 2005 and 2050 , Portugal will have 9.7 % more of its gross domestic product diverted to old age pensions .\n",
      "S As long as the country is financially capable , it is important to ensure that public spending on the aged is not limited so as to support the growing proportion of the aged in the country .\n",
      "S Firstly , the proportion of the elderly is increasing rapidly , especially in the developed countries .\n",
      "S For example , in Europe , while the total population is estimated to shrink slightly by 2050 , the aged population is foreseen to increase by 77 % ( \" Europe needs more reforms to be able to cope with raising age-related costs \" , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S There would be an increase in demand for healthcare , pensions and elderly-friendly facilities such as ramps and railings .\n",
      "S According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ( 2009 ) , expenditure on treating the health problems of the elderly in America has increased by almost a third .\n",
      "S Hence it is inevitable that a significant amount of money has to be allocated to the funding of these facilities and the much needed pensions .\n",
      "S So , public spending on the elderly should not be limited .\n",
      "S Secondly , social problems may surface if the elderly do not receive sufficient care and help they need from the government .\n",
      "S In Japan , pensioners constitute one-fifth of the country 's population .\n",
      "S More than half of the elderly who committed suicide in 2007 was due to health problems ( Paddock , 2008 ) .This is because this group of people is adversely affected by the government 's intention of reducing public spending on the pension and welfare system .\n",
      "S It is assumed that as people get older , they will have more health problems and thus need more money to seek medical help .\n",
      "S However , healthcare expenses in Japan are high and many lonely elderly have nobody to depend on except the government .\n",
      "S Thus , if the government chooses to reduce public spending on them , social issues such as elderly suicide rate may rise .\n",
      "S Lastly , it is a moral right and a civic responsibility for us to take care of the elderly .\n",
      "S They are the ones who worked hard and made sacrifices in their early days to provide us with the comfortable living we have today .\n",
      "S After all our education , can we really call ourselves a civilized nation if we close our eyes to the suffering of the elderly living with us ?\n",
      "S Therefore , government 's expenditure on the elderly should be allocated such that it is sufficient to help those elderly who are in need .\n",
      "S However , the government should take care of the country as a whole and not just focus on providing for the elderly .\n",
      "S The government should not neglect the need for funding the other development areas such as education and tourism that can boost the country 's economy .\n",
      "S With more resources allocated to the country due to its economic growth , the government can also spend some of these resources on the elderly .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , an efficient and well-organized government should have planned the national budget carefully and have allocated desirable amount of funds into the various aspects of spending areas in the country .\n",
      "S This is especially so for richer countries because they have the financial ability to finance sufficient resources into the different areas of development .\n"

      "S Hence there is no need to restrict public spending on the elderly just to have more resources to be diverted to other areas .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the number of elderly will constitute a significant proportion of the population in the near future in many countries .\n",
      "S There is an urgent need for the government to support these elderly , especially those without dependants , so as to prevent unnecessary negative social impacts on the society .\n",
      "S Furthermore , there is a moral need and obligation to take care of the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S Therefore , government 's expenditure on the elderly should not be restricted just because other areas of development of the country are assumed to be more important .\n",
      "S Instead , the government should strike a balance in the spending amongst the various sectors of the economy .\n",
      "S Singapore , like many countries in the world , is facing the same crisis - a rapid graying population .\n",
      "S The fast ageing population has brought about issues such as increased demand for better healthcare and social services , a reduction in competitiveness of the economy and increases the strain and burden of the working population .\n",
      "S By 2030 , local elderly population is estimated to reach a million ( CNA , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S In other words , there will be one elderly ( aged above 65 ) found in every five residents .\n",
      "S Hence , our local government will have to constantly review and implement appropriate policies to minimise these problems .\n",
      "S The government 's continuous efforts did not go unrecognised .\n",
      "S In fact , Singapore government has already predicted that such a situation would be faced and planning has started since a few decades back .\n",
      "S Thus , the Central Providence Fund ( CPF ) scheme was introduced in 1955 and made compulsory to all working Singaporeans to encourage self-dependency when they are old .\n",
      "S ( CPF , 2009 ) Furthermore , to increase the nation 's birth rate , Singapore government has enhanced benefits offered in the Marriage and Parenthood Package , which includes higher Parenthood Tax Rebate extended to Singaporeans with more children , but capped at $ 20,000 per child .\n",
      "S ( FCD , 2009 ) According to Lee Siew Hua , Senior Political Correspondent ( The Straits Times , 2008 ) , although benefits may be attractive , many young couples have no plans to settle down with a family immediately after marriage .\n",
      "S One of the reasons is due to other financial commitments like house installment , which has occupied a large portion of the couples ' salary .\n",
      "S ( The Straits Times , 2008 )\n",
      "S However , encouraging self-dependency and higher birth rate is insufficient to cope with the rising aged population .\n",
      "S Problems in the physical environment still pose a challenge to the senior citizens ' mobility , especially those who are wheelchair-bound .\n",
      "S Therefore , creating a barrier-free environment is necessary to cater to the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S For example , in the past , lifts only serve certain floors .\n",
      "S This has created much inconvenience in their daily activities .\n",
      "S To counter this problem , the Lifts Upgrading Programme ( LUP ) has been carried out in phases to upgrade older HDB blocks with lifts that stop at every floor .\n",
      "S In addition , more studio apartments will also be built to cater to the demands .\n",
      "S But , architects may have a harder time designing buildings now as their products must be of value yet able to beautify and sustain the Earth 's natural resources .\n",
      "S Also , due to the advancement in the field of medicine , life expectancy in Singapore has risen too .\n",
      "S With longer life span , larger range of chronic diseases is expected to surface .\n",
      "S This in turn , has generated demand for chronic disease management , geriatric services and other healthcare services .\n",
      "S For instance , Research and Development ( R&D ) has enabled cancer to be more controllable now .\n",
      "S To ensure that healthcare remains affordable for most Singaporeans , especially the lower-income group , the government gives different rates of subsidies to the different classes of wards in hospitals .\n",
      "S For example , Class C wards receive the most in subsidies .\n",
      "S ( Salma Khalik , The Straits Times , 2008 ) On top of this , the government also strongly encourages her senior citizens to adopt a healthy lifestyle .\n",
      "S For example , regular physical exercises and a well-balanced diet are encouraged .\n",
      "S In conclusion , Singapore government has played a huge part in easing the ageing population .\n",
      "S For instance , increase birth rate to surpass death rate , improve physical environment by creating barrier-free access , and continual effort towards R&D are some of the necessary areas for improvement .\n",
      "S Most importantly , planning for old age is a long-term goal .\n",
      "S One must plan well to enjoy a fulfilling golden age .\n",
      "S Public spending is the expenditure by government which includes health , education , military and development projects .\n",
      "S A fast aging population is a serious matter as this challenges the government to consider whether to reduce old age dependency or limit healthcare costs .\n",
      "S The government should allocate more resources to support other areas of the country 's development such as education policy and health care policy .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be used on those areas most in need .\n",
      "S Public policies encourage and facilitate education .\n",
      "S Spending needs are growing in many areas , including social spending .\n",
      "S The spending should focus subsidies on those most in need .\n",
      "S Due to the economic downturn , people are encouraged to spend more money so that this will help to increase the growth of the economy .\n",
      "S The public spending should be used in other areas of the country 's development like shopping malls , Integrated Resort , restaurants , hotels , museums , theatres , and theme parks .\n",
      "S The aim is to increase tourism industry and attract foreigners to spend more money .\n",
      "S For example , Integrated Resort projects in Singapore are expected to enlarge the industry .\n",
      "S Deputy Prime Minister S Jayakumar ( 2006 ) said that a large amount of money has been invested and the overall proposal that meets tourism objectives and requirements .\n",
      "S The purpose is to attract foreigners and to strengthen Singapore 's economic growth .\n",
      "S Public spending should be used to invest in the Health Ministry to analyse , investigate and produce more vaccines for the entire population to deal with influenza flu or virus .\n",
      "S The government should provide more resources and manpower to implement a plan to prevent the infectious diseases such as influenza vaccine , H1N1 flu vaccine .\n",
      "S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( 2007 ) stated that production of vaccines against new virus should be investigated to prevent in advance .\n",
      "S It is also necessary to produce enough vaccines to reduce the possible disease cases and deaths .\n",
      "S If the public spending on the aged is not limited , people will tend to depend on the governments more .\n",
      "S They will not save their income earned while they are active in the work force to provide in advance for their own old age as they will think that the government will support them and there will be more subsidies on medical and health care .\n",
      "S The retirement savings are important to plan in advance for the benefits of the elderly and they are encouraged to save for the retirement savings , medical savings and expenses .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited so that people will work harder .\n",
      "S They should learn to save more and plan for their old age in advance themselves .\n",
      "S They should not depend only on the governments subsidies on health care .\n",
      "S However , the birth rates are declining due to the economic downturn ; people nowadays will plan to have one or two children only .\n",
      "S This will make the future generations having more stressful life because they can not effort to support their parents .\n",
      "S In the absence of a subsidised health insurance scheme , people with serious illnesses or hospitalisation will be a problem especially when they pass the age of 85 or can not afford the increase premiums from age 80 to 85 .\n",
      "S Therefore , people will have pressure when they planning out for their old age .\n",
      "S In order to reduce the stresses , Central Provident Fund ( 2009 ) was set up as a compulsory savings scheme in Singapore so that they can use this savings to support themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S This is to ensure that people will not face financial problem when they retire .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the government should set boundaries on public spending on the aged so that people will learn how to plan financially for their own old age at the early stage .\n",
      "S Public spending can be also used in other areas of the country 's development to boost Singapore 's tourism industry .\n",

      "S In 2006 , roughly twenty-five percents of the Japanese population was over the working age and approximately eighteen percents was under the working age .\n",
      "S These figures are predicted to increase remarkably by 2050 .\n",
      "S The Chinese population , unfortunately , is also experiencing the same pattern .\n",
      "S Researchers forecast that one third of the population of this nation will retire in 2050 .\n",
      "S It obviously means that the rest fifty-seven percents in the first case or two third of the population in the second case have to work and support for both themselves and those who are unable to work .\n",
      "S It is reasonable to state that once the governments reduce the amount of money spending on healthcare system maintenance or accommodation subsidy , it might result in a social and political crisis .\n",
      "S Some might argue that the elderly should have their own savings , which were accumulated earlier in the working years to partly supports for the own needs .\n",
      "S However , not every worker can do so since the living expenses are increasing rapidly in a year basis .\n",
      "S Therefore , helps and assistances from external sources and funds are still essential .\n",
      "S One more factor that should be taken into account is the moral or ethic aspect .\n",
      "S The elderly used to work and devote their talents and efforts to the development of the country .\n",
      "S Therefore , their dedications and sacrifices should be respected and rather relevantly rewarded by younger generations .\n",

      "S A stable society in which all generations live in harmony requires a good moral foundation .\n",
      "S Once traditional values are reflected in the law , the law will be more practical and those traditional values will be more deeply ingrained in the society .\n",
      "S Furthermore , when the younger generation witnesses how their seniors are being whole-heartedly cared , they will have motivation to work harder and contribute to the country .\n",
      "S However , in some cases , the government probably should prioritize other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Let 's take Zimbabwe as an illustration .\n",
      "S In a country where inflation rate reached an unbelievable figure of 11.2 million percents , where almost every families have to struggle to put food on the table , where the only desire of the children is to go to school , a well-rounded health care system for the aged seems to be so luxurious .\n",
      "S The government here needs a drastic reform to restructure the entire political and administrative system before policies toward the old people could be brought to the conference table .\n",
      "S In brief , the policies toward the aged in each country seem to be widely different due to their very own and distinctive economic and social statuses .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , base on those different situations , each country should conduct more in-depth researches and take necessary steps with the view to promulgating both short-term and long-term policies to ensure that the senior citizens must get what they deserve .\n",

      "S With the current trend of ageing population , many countries came out with researches , development and policies which helped to ease the aging process greatly .\n",
      "S One such example is the introduction of Assistive Technology .\n",
      "S Technology has become one of the most important things for economic activity , education and innovation throughout the whole world .\n",
      "S As people age , their functionality depreciate in terms of physical and mental ability .\n",
      "S Therefore , in the United States of America , the policy of 'Assistive Technology Act of 1998 ' was introduced and the definition of Assistive technology is the use of technology design to develop any service or tool that helps the elderly or disabled to improve , maintain or to increase their functional capabilities .\n",
      "S The implementation of this policy brought about many technological inventions which in turn eased the elderly with movement , mental ability and emotional distress .\n",
      "S Impaired mobility is a major health concern for older adults and through Assistive Technology , technological invention has helped ease the movement for the elderly .\n",
      "S For example , the installation of grab bars around the tub and toilet bowl can help to prevent falls and reduce the risk of slipping ( A handbook of assistive devices for the handicapped elderly , Joseph M. Breuer , 1982 ) ; the invention of the elevator and escalator allows the elderly for easy movement from one storey to another in a building and the installing of bedside controls for lights and other appliances , which reduces the trouble of moving around just to switch off certain appliances .\n",
      "S Additionally , therapy technology has been designed to improve mobility in elderly patients to increase their leg strength or balance .\n",
      "S Memory loss is one of the biggest problems for old age and Assistive Technology has proven to aid the elderly in their mental ability .\n",
      "S For example , in America , The Center for Aging Services Technologies ( CAST ) ( 2009 ) developed e-pill CADEX and 12 Alarm Wristwatch which helps to remind elderly that it is time for their medication .\n",
      "S Nintendo also develop games such as Brain Training Game which are able to help to keep seniors stay mentally agile ( The Associated Press , 2006 ) Samsung 's Jitterbug , a mobile phone that is currently on the market offers the elderly an easier way in making calls , sending text messages and listening to voice mail .\n",
      "S ( Elder gadget review , James Alexander , 2009 )\n",
      "S Furthermore , emotional distress has impacted the elderly significantly .\n",
      "S With Assistive Technology , for example , as stated by Intel Corporation ( 2008 ) , poor cognitive ability can result in the increased in { loneliness } [ HYPERLINK : http : //dictionary.reference.com/browse/loneliness ] which may lead to depression and the use of sensor networks and online tools can help in reducing such symptoms .\n",
      "S Therefore they are researching on a product that uses in-home sensors to detect phone calls and visits that are integrated with online tools .With this product ; it can help to promote social activity .\n",
      "S Additionally , interactive technology such as Wii has enhanced social activity for the elderly , easing the distress they may face due to lack of companionship and social activity .\n",
      "S However , though technology has aid the ageing process through improvements in mobility , socially and mentally , but to the elderly , family and friends are ultimately one of the most important aspects to them .They can help them with money issues ; meet their social needs and provide a home for them .\n",
      "S This would greatly ease their emotional distress as human companionship is most important to them as they age , where they become increasingly lonely and require more attention .\n",
      "S The love and concern provided from the family that can ease the ageing process from the family can not be replaced by technology .\n",
      "S Hence , technology can be used as a tool to increase functionalities of the ageing adult but not able to provide the emotional support and care .\n",
      "S In conclusion , although human companionship is important to the elderly , the technological inventions created through Assistive Technology have helped to ease the aging process greatly in terms of movement , mental ability and emotional distress .\n",
      "S With these technological inventions , elderly functional capability would increase ; health issues may reduce and they can become more independent in their own life .\n",
      "S In today 's context , graying population has become an arising problem in many societies .\n",
      "S While it results in a delay to the country 's economic progress , the problem also imposes a burden to the children as well .\n",
      "S Thus , this highlights the need for effective policies and research to be implemented and conducted , in order to cushion the negative impacts of aging process .\n",
      "S Three significant solutions would be , improve economy , introduce elderly-friendly infrastructure and appropriate financial subsidies .\n"

      "S Increasing economic growth of the country helps to relieve the strain of resources to meet the demands of the elderly .\n",
      "S Monetary contribution is essential to aid the aging process .\n",
      "S However , this hinders the distribution of resources for the country 's development .\n",
      "S To improve the development of the economy , the government can attract more foreign investors .\n",
      "S According to the Foreign Direct Investment in Singapore statistics ( 2007 ) , Singapore received a total of 457,023.8 million investments from the world .\n",
      "S It showed that with potential lucrative economic growth , the country is able to amass more resources to cope with the needs of the society .\n",
      "S With the increased revenue , this reduces the limitation of support given to the elderly , without taxing on the government resources .\n",
      "S Therefore , the elderly could benefit from the greater availability of assistances without jeopardising economic progress .\n",
      "S The development of accessible infrastructure helps the aged in the adaption to the environment .\n",
      "S As human ages , mobility drops relatively .\n",
      "S As a result , immobility would be a hindrance to their lifestyle without the existence of convenient infrastructure .\n",
      "S Thus , physical assistance from the surroundings would be recommended .\n",
      "S According to the Housing And Development Board ( HDB ) policy ( 2005 ) , Lift Upgrading Programme ( LUP ) was introduced to install lifts at every level in the HDB residential flats .\n",
      "S As compared to the past , the elderly had much difficulty managing the stairs .\n",
      "S Thus , this implementation helps to accommodate the inconvenience of the elderly .\n",
      "S Therefore , establishment of accessible infrastructure helps the elderly to adjust more easily .\n",
      "S Financial subsidies would also help to lessen the dependency of the elderly on their children .\n",
      "S As elderly productivity decreases with age , the ability to command the same income as before is almost impossible .\n",
      "S Hence , they would have difficulty maintaining their standard of living .\n",
      "S Therefore , appropriate financial assistances are recommended to help cope with their essential needs .\n",
      "S Australia is a welfare state that strongly emphasise the well-being of the elderly .\n",
      "S Policies such as age pensions and medical benefits allow her aged to receive sufficient assistances to cope with the financial needs ( Greg , 2003 ) .\n",
      "S On the one hand , the subsidy system compensates the lower income that the elderly have relatively .\n",
      "S On the other hand , this reduces the children 's burden to support the parents .\n",
      "S Therefore , the dependency on the shoulder of the children to take care of their elderly would be lightened .\n",
      "S On the contrary , implementating subsidy system requires heavy tax foundation which will be a burden on the working society .\n",
      "S A massive subsidy system is needed to sustain the hefty expenses of supporting an increasingly graying population .\n",
      "S This would be a substantial load on the working people , who would then be responsible for contributing to the welfare system of the elderly .\n",
      "S Consequently , this solution would not be effective in the long run due to the money-consuming factor in the problem .\n",
      "S As a result , there should be a classification of the degree of need , in order to create an efficient subsidy system .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the negative impact of the aging process is inevitable .\n",
      "S Therefore , feasible solutions are in need of implementation to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , due to cultural differences , the requirements of our elderly population will alter gradually .\n",
      "S Thus , research and policies need to be revised to deal with the aging process effectively .\n",
      "S It is known that the world is facing the problem of an ageing population .\n",
      "S David E. Bloom , David Canning and Gunther Fink ( April 2008 ) have shown with projected statistics that between year 2000 and 2050 , the population of the world for those aged 60 and above will increase in every country .\n",
      "S With this increasing amount of the elderly , there are going to be consequences in areas such as the economical growth , the amount of national budget that we are spending and healthcare issues .\n",
      "S Thus , several policies which have helped to ease the consequences are being put in place .\n",
      "S These policies are successful with easing of the ageing process .\n",
      "S We will now look into some of the policies that help to ease the ageing population .\n",
      "S One of the policies that were being introduced was that of the retirement age .\n",
      "S Under the retirement act ( 1999 ) , the Ministry of Manpower , Singapore raised the retirement age for elderly from 60 to 62 .\n",
      "S By doing so , the elderly will be able to work longer and thus , they will be able to save up more money in order to support themselves during their old age .\n",
      "S However , we do have to take note that some of the elderly are unable to work even though the retirement age has been raised .\n",
      "S This is due to the fact that some of them do not possess the necessary skills needed for the job or they could be down with some illness causing them to be unfit for work .\n",
      "S Thus , there is a need for other policies in order to protect this vulnerable group of elderly .\n",
      "S Another policy that was being introduced was that of the Maintenance of Parents Act .\n",
      "S This act is a new policy mentioned by Prime Minister Lee during the National Day Rally Speech 2009 .\n",
      "S It mainly acts on cases where the younger generations abandon their parents .\n",
      "S This way , it will ensure that the parents are not being abandoned by their children .\n",
      "S However , we also have to take into consideration that the children might have reasons for not supporting their parents .\n",
      "S One very good example was mentioned in a Channel Newsasia article ( \" Social sector wants govt \" , august 2009 ) .\n",
      "S It was mentioned by Associate Professor Paulin Straugha , National University of Singapore in the article that one hospitalization trip could cost tens of thousands of money , where is the younger generation going to get the money from ?\n",
      "S Therefore , by implementing this policy , it could cause more stress on the younger generations and it could also strain the relation between the elderly and the children .\n",
      "S Next , we will look at another policy which the government came up with .\n",
      "S This policy is to give out financial aids to the needy .\n",
      "S In Singapore , these come in the form of the topping of the Medisave account and cheaper housing options .\n",
      "S In the report on the ageing population found on the government website ( { www.gov.sg } [ HYPERLINK : http : //www.gov.sg ] ) , it was mentioned that the government should top up the Medisave account of the needy when there is a budget surplus so that the needy elderly will be able to afford medical treatments .\n",
      "S It was also mentioned that HDB should introduce more rental housing options for the elderly , this can be done by exploring the rental of the vacant flats\n",
      "S In conclusion , with these policies in place , the elderly in Singapore are able to protect all types of elderly ( Those who can work , those who ca n't work , and those who are ill ) .\n",
      "S In Singapore , it was mentioned in a report found on the family and community development website ( { www.fcd.gov.sg } [ HYPERLINK : http : //www.fcd.gov.sg ] ) that the majority of Singaporeans have positive attitudes towards providing concern and support to the elderly .\n",
      "S Thus , with such positive attitudes and policies , the process of ageing can be eased .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged has been increasing in recent years due to the ageing population , which results in lesser spending on the other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Demographers predicted that by the end of the century , people who are aged 65 and above will be tripled .\n",
      "S This may pose many challenges to the society especially for developing countries , where poverty is evident .\n",
      "S The small labour force has to carry the burden of supporting the aged in the country and with increasing cost for goods and services , income inequality may be resulted .\n",
      "S In addition , the increasing demand on the country 's healthcare system will cause the country to divert many resources for the healthcare industry thus neglecting the other potential areas .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited because of the smaller labour force supporting its retirees in a country with an ageing population .\n"

      "S This causes taxes , budgets , living standards and economic growth to be adversely affected .\n",
      "S Unless benefits are cut , taxes to pay for pensions and health care may have to be doubled in the next few decades ( Hoke,2005 ) .\n",
      "S With ageing countries directing much attention to the aged , for instance , spending large sums of money on hiring healthcare workers and on the latest medical technology , there will be lesser investments made in other areas like military , tourism , education and research and development .\n",
      "S Hence , this will greatly hinder the development of these countries and deter national progression ( Dooling,2009 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , the smaller labour force will face with many difficulties in supporting the retirees due to the high cost .\n",
      "S Secondly , there is a need to limit spending on the aged due to increasing costs of basic necessities ( Missouri Progressive Vote Coalition,2006 ) .\n",
      "S There are many other groups of people such as the poor , sick and disabled who need help apart from the aged .\n",
      "S If goods and services become consistently more costly , this will widen the gap between the rich and poor ( Reuter,2007 ) .\n",
      "S For a country to progress , income inequality is less than desirable ( Dorling , Mitchell & Pearce,2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , there are situations where the aged can still support themselves and contribute to the country .\n",
      "S In Australia , reports have shown that the aged have been contributing to the country socially and economically in many ways .\n",
      "S People age between 65- 69 years old still form part of the workforce and some of the aged have been providing financial support for grown up children or relatives despite of their meagre income .\n",
      "S Furthermore , they have been providing voluntary services by actively involving themselves in community organisations ( Australian Institute of Health and Welfare,2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , aged who have the ability to contribute to the country will only form the minority .\n",
      "S The increasing cost will outweigh their contributions .\n",
      "S Thus , more funds have to be set aside to lessen the strains on the people caused by the increasing costs of basic necessities .\n",
      "S Finally , as the population gets older , there is an increase in demand on the country 's healthcare system , where spending on it should be limited .\n",
      "S The United States predicted that the demand for medical care will significantly outweigh the supply of healthcare professionals by year 2020 ( University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences,2009 ) .\n",
      "S The Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) is also facing demand for health care where it is likely to increase by 240 percent over the next couple of decades ( Walid,2008 ) .\n",
      "S These will mean that the countries will be diverting plenty of resources on the supply of health care and neglecting the potential of the other areas which may help to generate wealth for the country .\n",
      "S Hence , countries should limit their spending on health care to invest in other potential opportunities .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the fact that people now live longer poses many challenges to a country .\n",
      "S The government and the public are contributing a vast amount of resources to support the aged , hindering the overall development of the country .\n",
      "S To lessen the impact of the aged on the country , the aged can learn to keep fit and healthy to reduce healthcare dependency .\n",
      "S In order for a country to grow and prosper , significant contributions are needed to support its funding and hence , public spending on the aged should be limited so that money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S Based on the report of the United States Census Bureau , there are 506 million people hitting 65 years old and above as of mid 2008 .\n",
      "S This figure will be doubled to 1.3 billion by 2040 , which accounts for 14 percent of the total global population .\n",
      "S Mr Richard Suzman ( 2009 ) mentioned that the problem of aging is affecting every part of the world .\n",
      "S Both developed and developing countries are challenged by the difficulties resulting from global aging such as limitation of public spending on the health care of the elderly .\n",
      "S Although there 's no doubt that health care of the elderly plays an important role in public spending , it should still be limited so that funds can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development such as education .\n",
      "S Cost-containment measures on the health care of the elderly have been practised by many governments all over the world .\n",
      "S Japan is a successful example in controlling the health care cost for the elderly .\n",
      "S The government titles most of the financial incentives to primary care .\n",
      "S It leaves some available services to the family .\n",
      "S Japan has also adopted more efficient ways of financing health care and paying claims using a regulated all payers system which allows payment through a standard system .\n",
      "S Compared with the US , it mainly relies on market competition to provide health care .\n",
      "S There are many insurance companies hiring lots of agents to sell their products and each of the insurance company has its own system .\n",
      "S This will result in high cost of health care services .\n",
      "S Thus , some perspectives can be adopted from Japan , for example how to set limits for hospital services , in order to lower the health care costs .\n",
      "S Public spending should focus on areas that play an important part in country 's development like education sector .\n",
      "S According to the Budget Speech ( Tharman Shanmugaratnam , 2009 ) , the government has an budget of S $ 18.1 billion expenditure in social development which mainly comprises six Ministries : Ministry of Education ( MOE ) , Ministry of Health ( MOH ) , Ministry of National Development ( MND ) , Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports ( MCYS ) , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources ( MEWR ) and Ministry of Information , Communications and the Arts ( MICA ) .\n",
      "S A total budget of S $ 8,701 million has been planned to be invested in education , accounting for nearly half of the expenditure budgeted for social development .\n",
      "S The government maintains that the expenditure on education sector would never be cut back even in the economic downturn .\n",
      "S The government heavily subsidise the education fees in schools and tertiary institutions every year to prepare students for the future .\n",
      "S In this way , public spending on the elderly should be balanced with other sectors .\n",
      "S In addition , with the limitation on the elderly , people would be encouraged to work harder to accumulate more wealth before they retire .\n",
      "S It would tremendously relief the government 's burden as they could support themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S However , some may argue that the government should provide more public spending on health services instead of encouraging the elderly to later retirement .\n",
      "S It may seem true in some way as the elderly have less ability to perform as well as younger work force .\n",
      "S More funds should be invested in health services instead of paying salaries to the working elderly .\n",
      "S However , there are increasing pressures on social benefits including health services fund especially during economic crisis .\n",
      "S The limited fund could only be used in those more deserving areas such as public health services ; therefore , the elderly should be encouraged to work harder to reduce the fiscal dependency .\n",
      "S In conclusion , there must be some limitation on the public spending in order to divert the money to other areas contributed in country 's development .\n",
      "S The elderly should be encouraged to work harder to support themselves in their old age .\n",
      "S With many countries successfully practising cost-containment measures on health care , a lot of perspectives can be learned to spend the public funding within the limitation .\n",
      "S Besides , considerable efforts should also be made to educate the public to lead a more healthful life .\n",
      "S The problem of an aging population is increasingly affecting more countries .\n",
      "S Especially in the developed countries , due to reasons like better healthcare and women joining the workforce , life expectancy increases significantly as the rate of reproduction decreases .\n",
      "S As the population ages , social problems follow after .\n",
      "S Many governments , in view of this problem , would invest more resources , especially in monetary terms , to seek remedy .\n",
      "S However , this is a bottomless pit .\n",
      "S A better solution would be to limit direct spending on the age and redirect these resources to aid the country 's development .\n",
      "S In fact , this can indirectly ease the stress of an aging population through developing the research and development industry and providing skills training for workers .\n",
      "S The research and development industry is important as it brings about new technology , which can help to improve the standard of living of people .\n",
      "S One crucial area is the research and development of healthcare .\n",
      "S By investing money in research and development , more is done to explore new treatment solutions for existing illness thus , allowing healthcare treatments to be more efficient .\n",
      "S This not only in turn improves the economy ; it also provides more options for the elders when they have to seek treatment .\n",
      "S New methods of healthcare treatment often bring down the cost of it too .\n",

      "S Angelique Chan mentioned at present , employers tend to be hesitant about hiring older workers and this has led to public debates on this issue ( n.d. ) This affects blue collared workers most extensively , and also happen to be the group of elders that have the highest dependency on the society due to their lower savings .\n",
      "S Providing trainings like the \" Skills Programme for Upgrading and Resilience \" program , which the Singapore government has introduced in 2008 , helps improve worker 's skills .\n",
      "S In addition , not only does it equip the elders with the essential skills to continue contributing to the workforce , it also increases their employability .\n",
      "S Furthermore , these training programs can also be catered to the unemployed .\n",
      "S Allowing those who were retrenched due to company downsizing or the likes of it can take the opportunity to improve on their skills and move up the corporate ladder .\n",
      "S Thus , this not only benefits the elders , it also benefits the general public as a whole .\n",
      "S In conclusion , although spending money on the elderly can help ease the problem effectively in the short run , it is not a feasible solution , as one must consider the effects in the long run .\n",
      "S By endlessly investing in assisting the elderly , areas of country developments will be overlooked , resulting in more serious social problems like unemployment .\n",
      "S Thus , spending on the aged should be limited so that more financial resources can be used to fund other areas of development , which in the long run , can actually help to ease the problem of an aging population .\n",
      "S Singapore is gradually moving into an aging population due to low birth rate and long life expectancy .\n",
      "S According to Mr Lee Hsien Loong , Prime Minister of Singapore , our median age today is 36 and the life expectancy is 80 years .\n",
      "S By 2050 , our median age will be expected to be 54 .\n",
      "S One of the reports estimated that \" the demographic change would slice 3 percentage points from long-term economic growth , while possible government support for the elderly could cost the country more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) .\n",
      "S \" ( Bryan , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S This shows that an aging population will result in lower productivity and affect our economies .\n",
      "S Bryan ( 2008 ) also suggested that healthcare and social cost will also increase as there will be longer life span due to better healthcare quality .\n",
      "S Therefore , to pre-empt the problems of aging population , several policies have been introduced and helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S These policies include social security , healthcare and housing .\n",
      "S Firstly , an aging population will have fewer working adults to support the elder dependents .\n",
      "S According to PM Lee , our social security system is based mainly on self-reliance and individual savings .\n",
      "S Policies such as encouraging a long work life and having mandatory savings have been implemented to enable each person to be self-reliant during old age .\n",
      "S For example , our official retirement age has been raised to 65 ; this allows people to work longer to accumulate more wealth for old age .\n",
      "S Many programs have also been set up to retrain the elder workers and upgrade their skill in order to maintain their work productivity .\n",
      "S These have helped to increase the employability rate for elder workers .\n",
      "S Furthermore , a mandatory saving scheme , called the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , has also been set up to ensure people to save as they work .\n",
      "S These savings can be withdrawn in stages when one reaches the retirement age and can also be used for medical expenses .\n",
      "S However , the CPF scheme may not be as useful as the money that can be used for medical expenses is restricted to Medisave and Medifund .\n",
      "S Moreover , in the case of an elder person is incapable of continuing to work before he meets the official retirement age , he is unable to make any withdrawals from his CPF accounts to cover his daily expenses .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , these two strategies are able to reduce elder dependency .\n",
      "S Secondly , healthcare system has been restructuring to meet the needs of the aging population .\n",
      "S Hasnita ( 2009 ) reported that besides building new hospitals around neighbourhood , Singapore also focus on its step-down care sector which includes community hospitals and nursing homes .\n",
      "S PM Lee also added one vital step which is to associate acute hospitals with neighbourhood ones so that patients can seek treatment at the acute hospital and transfer to the neighbourhood hospital for recuperation .\n",
      "S This approach will help to free up beds in the acute hospital for more severe cases to be treated .\n",
      "S Through the reorganization , the new healthcare system will be able to accommodate more people .\n",
      "S Lastly , according to Mr Yap Chin Beng , Director , Estate Administration and Property , they have worked closely with Housing Development Board ( HDB ) to initiate policies such as constant upgrading to our physical infrastructures to become more elderly-friendly .\n",
      "S The upgrades include lift upgrading to install new lifts which stops on every floor , shelters to connect to the nearest bus stop of the blocks and ramps for people who have difficulties in climbing stairs .\n",
      "S These upgrading projects have helped to create convenience for the elderly , especially for those who are disabled .\n",
      "S In addition , HDB is also building more studio apartments which are suitable for elderly as it is customized with elderly-friendly fixtures and fittings .\n",
      "S These two approaches have helped to make an elder-friendly physical environment .\n",
      "S Clearly , current policies such as social security , healthcare and housing have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Without these policies , the elderly will be facing problems in terms of monetary , healthcare and housing in future .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is important to help the older population remain employed and promote active aging .\n",
      "S Nowadays , many countries have to face different problems about aging population .\n",
      "S The popular one is about public spending for the elderly in each country .\n",
      "S It is controversial since many people are afraid that spending too much money on the elderly might decrease national budgets for other areas ' development .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is necessary that the public finances spent on the elderly be always considered carefully by the government .\n",
      "S A limited amount of money given to help the aging population is a good issue for both the elderly and the rest of population which is benefited through the development of different sectors of the country .\n",
      "S It is undoubtedly true that senior citizens always find it difficult to live independently in such the old age .\n",
      "S They need financial sources from not only their own children but also from the society .\n",
      "S For instance , the Singaporean government spent more than 7 percent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) on supporting the elderly with medical subsidies , public infrastructure and pension schemes ( Central Provident Fund- CPF ) , etc... while the percent of American GDP for public spending on the elderly may rise from 8.5 percent in 1997 to 22.5 percent in 2070 ( Lee , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Moreover , a significant share of Gross National Product ( GNP ) went into pension schemes : 0.58 per cent and 1.22 per cent , respectively in Malaysia and Singapore ( Yoon and Hendricks , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S Another example about public spending on medical subsidies for the aged is the elderly , who represented about 7 per cent of the South Korean population , accounted for 17.7 per cent of total National Health Insurance ( NHI ) expenditures in 2001 ( Yoon and Hendricks , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S These above numbers show us the truth that the government spent a lot of money for the senior citizens .\n",
      "S We need to have the responsibility to the elderly .\n"

      "S However , we should not spend such a large amount of money on the elderly since it might cause the loss of financial supporting for other important areas ' development such as education , military or infrastructure , etc...

      "S In my opinion , the limitation for public spending on the aged is a good issue for the entire population .\n",
      "S We actually have many kinds of help for the senior citizens instead of giving them money from the public budgets .\n",
      "S For example , the financial problem can be solved by encouraging the elderly to work longer .\n",
      "S They can earn money by themselves .\n",
      "S Then , we are able to spend our money to develop other areas in our country .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the elderly now have a long-term provision for their own lives by their income and contribute their ability to the society .\n",

      "S To apply for health subsidy , the government assess elderly patients by taking into consideration the gross income of the patient and immediate family members as well as whether patients own any private property .\n",

      "S It is a necessity to raise awareness concerning the issue of aging population .\n",
      "S Welcoming immigrants and increasing fertility rates are some of the issues that should become national priority and these subjects will be discussed in relation to the Singapore context .\n",
      "S Although the relieving of the aging process is unlikely to take effect immediately after the implementation of the policies , much can still be done to ease the impact of an aging population .\n",
      "S Firstly , the aging process should be eased by allowing more working-age immigrants .\n",
      "S Minister Mentor , Lee Kuan Yew ( 2009 ) mentions that there are complains about the welcoming of working-age immigrants resulting in a reduction of job vacancies available for Singaporeans .\n",
      "S Immigrants who possessed the skills and expertise in the various industries were more favorable by employers .\n",
      "S This is because they could contribute their knowledge and bring the companies to greater heights .\n",
      "S Hence , this caused Singaporeans who were not as proficient to become unemployed .\n",
      "S The introducing of working-age immigrants also increased the competition in the workforce .\n",
      "S Eventually , social issues like a surge in suicidal cases and psychological problems will surface .\n",
      "S Furthermore , immigrants who set up businesses or companies in Singapore would create more job vacancies .\n",
      "S They could share their knowledge and technology with Singapore and Singapore could in return , provide them the necessary infrastructure and manpower .\n",
      "S This will certainly be a win-win situation where both Singaporeans and immigrants will benefit .\n",
      "S In addition , competition in the labor force might stimulate people to be more eager and determined to improve themselves .\n",
      "S They will be shocked by the competitiveness and drive themselves to perform better .\n",
      "S This will bring about a progress in the overall standard of the country and the economy .\n",
      "S Secondly , the process of aging should be relieved by increasing fertility rates .\n",
      "S With the influx in immigrants and foreign talents , most Singaporeans believed that Singapore 's current population is considerably large .\n",
      "S Minister Mentor , Lee Kuan Yew ( 2009 ) points out that between age 25 and 40 , more than 30 % of the Singaporeans remain single and childless .\n",
      "S Many Singaporeans do not want their careers to be hindered and deem it is not worth paying the high fees of educating their children .\n",
      "S Despite the introduction of the baby bonus scheme , Singaporeans were still unmoved and cold toward having a child .\n",
      "S However , increasing the fertility rates to replace the aging population in Singapore is vital .\n",
      "S Being a small country , Singapore is vulnerable to many threats and people is her only resource .\n",
      "S If low fertility rate continues , Singapore 's economy and labour force will eventually shrink .\n",
      "S Thus , it is essential to introduce campaigns and educate Singaporeans on the importance of family formation .\n",
      "S The government could look into ways like longer maternity leaves , financial supports in the form of tax rebates and maintaining work-life balance by allocating sufficient time for personal life .\n",
      "S Numerous countries experience population aging .\n",
      "S The older population is expanding at a substantially faster rate than that of the world 's total population .\n",
      "S Presently , the total fertility rate is below the replacement level in essentially all industrialized countries .\n",
      "S The dramatic shift in age structure caused the Singapore government to introduce many related policies .\n",
      "S Singapore 's response has been to welcome immigrants , introduce baby bonus and many more .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the easing of the aging process should be a national effort .\n",
      "S The future is to assure that people everywhere age with confidence and courtliness and continue to enjoy full rights .\n",
      "S In the last 10 years , governments all over the world , especially those in developed countries such as Japan , United Kingdom , Singapore , etc , invested heavily in research and development and formulating new policies to tackle the prevailing ageing phenomenon which is threatening their economies .\n",
      "S However , some policies introduced by the government are causing much problem for the society which outweighs the effect of easing the ageing process .\n",
      "S In this paper , two strategies , one of which encourages older retirement and the other leads to the increase in foreign immigration , introduced by the local government to tackle the ageing population issue shall be discussed .\n",
      "S In 2007 , the government introduced a CPF ( Central Provident Fund ) reform scheme , which will push retirement age to 65 years old in 2012 which will then par with Japan .\n",
      "S This , coupled with other initiatives such as the workfare to older workers and incentives for companies to hire elderly workers , serves to encourage longer working lives and decrease dependency among elderly workers .\n",
      "S However , according to the Singapore National Census in 2007 , 68 % of the elder workers are unskilled and most of them are employed as cleaners or laborers , working long hours per day for mostly as little as $ 5 an hour ( Hoe Yeen Nie : 2009 ) .\n",
      "S However , many might argue that through employment , older workers will be able to earn their upkeep , save up for future medical needs and live an active and healthy lifestyle ( PM Lee.H.L : 2009 ) .\n",
      "S But on the contrary , it has been statistically proven that older workers tend to suffer from occupational injuries that were inflicted and accumulated since younger working days , thus accidents are more prone to occur , especially for jobs which require substantial amount of physical strength such as lifting or carrying ( Craig.Z el at : 1996 ) .\n",
      "S Besides , elderly workers can get abused just as much as younger workers , by considering the fact that if elder workers were to be dismissed for some reasons , finding another employment with equal remunerations and similar job tasks might not be easy .\n",
      "S In additional , if they were to be subjected to demands of work performance and long work hours in most jobs , how could they ever live a healthier lifestyle ?\n",
      "S On the contrary , older workers could develop more medical problems as they continue to work and grow older .\n",
      "S Therefore , it can be said that governments who support older retirement age could have committed the fallacy of equating both wealth and health together when it is the other way around .\n",
      "S Singapore has been adopting an \" open-door \" policy which favors foreign immigration as part of the strategy to overcome ageing population .\n",
      "S With a healthy supply of young workers from other countries , Singapore can fill up job vacancies quickly and replacing those older workers .\n",
      "S By \" one stone killing two birds \" , it can be said that foreign immigration solves both ageing problem as well as babies shortages .\n",
      "S However , with the influx of foreigners into the economy , cultural clashes will occur and more often than not , misunderstandings due to language differences arise .\n",
      "S According to a survey published by Institute of Service Excellence ( ISES ) last year , Singapore has a lower service level satisfactory score of 68 compared to 72 in South Korea and 75 in the States ; one of the reasons is the ease of foreign immigration here .\n",
      "S Nowadays , many semi-skilled foreign immigrants are working in service sectors , and even greeting many customers in their mother tongue .\n",
      "S As a result , tourists and even mainland Singaporeans are often put off by their incomprehensible enunciation and insolent intonation of their native language .\n",
      "S Thus , businesses in these sectors employing lower cost foreign workers might lose the goodwill of customers .\n",
      "S Therefore , in the long term , it could hurt the service industry 's economies and so , this policy contradicts the main objective of having a strong labor economy .\n",
      "S Singapore 's policy to tackle the ageing issue has so far achieved limited success but the side-effects caused by their implementations have greater adversities which outweigh the benefits .\n",
      "S There can never be a single solution or working policy in the battle against ageing population but however , besides the government , each and every individual can actually play a part for their future .\n",
      "S After all , we all grow old one day .\n",

      "S Besides , younger workers still have various work chances , especially , when companies do know about the creativity , activity and intelligence of younger workers .\n",
      "S Ian Ziskin , chief of human resource and administrative office of Northman Grumman , says that it 's necessary to have new brand of workforce in a company and his company will keep hiring young workers for the next 5 to 10 years ( Emily Brandon , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S In a short , encouraging later retirement of employee remains effective solution to reduce the burden of old aging .\n",
      "S The second solution being discussed in many countries is raising the adult children 's responsibility for caring their older parents .\n",
      "S Every year , governments have to spend around 0.2 % to 3 % of total GDP to take care of old people and the number is increasing year by year ( oegd publication , 2005 ) .\n",
      "S Does the \" light care \" of family toward older people help to reduce this ?\n",
      "S In fact , this caring plays critical role in easing the spending of government and citizen on health care for the elderly .\n",
      "S According to the Genworth Financial Cost of Care Survey ( 2006 ) , the average fees of nursing care for the elderly is $ 194 per day which does not include the fees of medical care , therapy , etc .\n",
      "S It means you have to pay nearly $ 6000 per month for caring your parents , which is such a large amount especially in the economic critics recently .\n",
      "S Home care for the older parents , therefore , seems to be acceptable for a lot of families to reduce the cost .\n",
      "S From the government 's view , this strategy really saves a lot of money for them .\n",
      "S According to AARP ( 2006 ) , home care saved up to $ 350 billion in 2006 , which is even over the Fed 's budget .\n",
      "S In USA , just only 50 % of adult say that they are caring for their parents ( home caring or supporting money ) so if we can raise this number up by increasing the grown children 's responsibility , we can save our budget to pay attention to other necessary fields .\n",
      "S Briefly , home caring is going to be the long term plan for us to cope with the problem of aging population in the future .\n",
      "S Although there is still skepticism around the two policies which are used to ease the pressure of aging population , a number of study and facts have shown us their benefit to our society .\n",
      "S Later retirement not only helps elder feel more active and healthier but also brings us a large sum of money .\n",
      "S Similarly , increasing adult 's responsibility for their older parents particularly assists the government in caring a number of older people and saving health care 's fees .\n",
      "S By and large , until we find the better way to balance the global population , the two solutions are , at least , beneficial .\n",

      "S However , this policy has been strongly disagreed .\n",
      "S One of the opposing views was the doubt about the olds strengths and perspicacity .\n",

      "S In addition , they can even train those inexperienced young .\n",
      "S Many companies nowadays have changed their views and greatly welcome these skilled workers .\n",
      "S More importantly , if we extended people 's working age , which would give them several years to devote and save more for their old age , we would greatly ease the aging problem .\n",
      "S About 50 thousands people step into retirement each year , which will then contribute to the dependency ratio .\n",
      "S By encouraging people to work for some more years if they still can work well , we would somehow reduce negative effects of this dilemma .\n",

      "S Initially , increasing the certain age of retirement would alleviate the burden of aging population .\n",
      "S The retirement age of Singapore is currently 62 .\n",
      "S By this policy , if the retirement age is increased by a number of 5 years , the policy makers would have more time to activate some other policies such as boosting the fertility rates or allowing entrepreneurs to employ foreign workers temporarily .\n",
      "S In addition , the more time elder people can work , the more savings or pension they will have to secure their life sufficiently at the old age without being dependent on their children or the governmental fund .\n",
      "S The policy , however , has its own hinders .\n",
      "S Later retirement could cause a decrease in productivity because old people tend to be less healthy or less up-to-date with the new technology , information than the younger ones .\n",
      "S The payment system based on the operation of age for a company could make it more expensive to pay for the old workers than the younger ones .\n",
      "S Secondly , the attempt to raise the fertility rates could also be one the possible solutions .\n",
      "S In fact , this solution somehow could ensure the economy that it would be sufficient new generation of workforce to provide for the labour market when it comes to the time for the previous generation to get retired .\n",
      "S However , the policy might encounter a big obstacle , i.e .\n",
      "S how to ensure that there will be enough space for all people to accommodate in a condition of land scarcity , especially in Singapore , a country with total area of 710.2 square kilometres .\n",
      "S Also , the policy might take at least 20 years to become feasible once it is started .\n",
      "S But in recent years , the Singapore 's government has put more effort to tackle the housing issue , which can be seen through HDB 's building programme to provide more public housing for residential use and allow citizens to make loans up to 80 % of the value of the flat to make it more affordable for everyone .\n",
      "S As aforementioned above , in the mean time for the next new generation of workforce , the government can consider employing immigrants for a short period of 10 or 20 years .\n",
      "S This solution seems to have been adapted fairly well by the Singapore 's government since the beginning of the 21st century , and the immigrant workers have been closely associated with the economic development of the country .\n",
      "S Like many other solutions , the government should be aware of this policy 's hidden risk involving the race issue .\n",
      "S Many immigrants coming from different regions of the world with many different cultures and religions might result in conflicts between them .\n",
      "S Plus , since a lot of immigrant workers with different nationalities , their skills might not be similar or adequate enough to meet with the requirement of the jobs .\n",
      "S To solve the problem , a new standard of skills for immigrants should be established or the government should have the immigrant workers re-trained for the country 's purposes although it might take time and quite lots of money .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the problem of aging population is rather a problem of rigid and outmoded policies and institutions than only a problem of a demographic change .\n",

      "S Statistical researches have shown that most couples are unable to sustain two or more children due to the high cost of living and constant increase in inflation .\n",
      "S Despite of these economic constraints , there is still an urgent need for the government to increase the amount of children per household to replace the huge retiring labor force in order to maintain the economic growth within a country .\n",
      "S By having sufficient replacement in the labor force , it will generate adequate taxes and economic returns for the government to provide public pensions and subsidized health programs for the aging population .\n",
      "S On top of that , producing more children also means that it enables the future generations to better distribute their social responsibilities in the context of fulfilling their filial obligations , resulting in lesser elder dependency on the government .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government should implement policies such as giving monetary incentives and tax rebates to encourage the current generation to produce more children .\n",

      "S However , such subsidies will be available on a case-by-case basis where only infertile couples who fall below a certain household income range will be entitled these subsidies .\n",

      "S \" Nevertheless , this is a difficult task as the efficiency and productivity of elderly workers decreases relative to their increase in age .\n",
      "S This means that it is less likely to reduce elder dependency if there are no substantial benefits to employ such employees .\n",
      "S However , with the creation of new policies such as tax rebates , it will attract employers to hire older workers .\n",
      "S For example , giving tax rebates to employers who hire more than three workers aged 60 and above .\n",
      "S Besides targeting the employers , the government can try improving the productivity of elderly workers by offering training or retraining for employees above the age of 50 .\n",
      "S These schemes will equip the aging community with sufficient technological/technical knowledge to remain productive and efficient in the labor force despite of their disadvantages .\n",

      "S At the beginning of 21st century , we have to deal with a series of global issues , among them the aging population should be considered as a black spot .\n",
      "S Not only putting adverse impacts on other members in their families , the elder people day to day cause many troubles to societies'developments in general .\n",
      "S Beside the expense for societal aging , there are also sponsors from the government which need be diverted to other fields .\n",
      "S For these reasons , it should be better if the money pent on the aged is deliberately limited for investing on many critical factors of the national economy .\n",
      "S To begin with , it can not be denied that the governments have to care for elders partly because they were n't much concerned about their health in the past .\n",
      "S Along with the improvement of living standards , people have got used to the sedentary lifestyle - having a seat all day without any exercise .\n",
      "S Besides , during their adolescence , probably time for studying and various kinds of indoor entertainment such as movies or PC games contrained them from joining in outdoor activities and unintentionally stole the essential fundamentals for their health afterwards .\n",
      "S According to a study in 2004 , 20 percent of all deaths of people 35 and older were related to the lack of physical activities , even higher than those involved in smoking .\n",
      "S Moreover , because of the unawareness of humans , our damaged environment is really pushing us to the verge of the extinction .\n",
      "S Hence , before receiving public funds , aged people as well as their future generations should review their lifestyles to rescue themselves .\n",
      "S Secondly , the aged generation could strain national budgets .\n",
      "S When the aging population is excessive , this results in extra enormous expenditure and the government is pressured to ask the citizens for higher taxes .\n",
      "S However , once such taxes are applied , the poors unexpectedly become the first victims .\n",
      "S Naturally being full of financial issues , the more difficult and challenging life can push these innocent people to illegal behaviors .\n",
      "S Furthermore , due to high taxes , the reduced incomes of citizens could have negative impacts on their purchase and in the same way , the domestic market and the economy in general might be caused a lot of trouble .\n",
      "S Countries with extended programs serving for health care to the aged might find the escalation in the cost when the number of recipients rises .\n",
      "S By 2050 , some economists predict that the fiscal burden of the financial crisis , for advanced countries , will be only about 10 percent of the ageing-related expense .\n",
      "S Additionally , it is clear that a nation 's development is ruled by a lot of factors .\n",
      "S Some of them like education and military are compulsory and indispensable since they have unreplaceable roles in the destiny as well as a country 's future .\n",
      "S For this reason , too much money paid for caring the graying population means the shortage of concern on other essential areas .\n",
      "S Meanwhile , it might be recognized that public spending on the aged should be encouraged as a charity activity instead of being mandatory .\n",
      "S Why ?\n",
      "S The elderly can be looked after by their own families as a traditional aspect before relying on the support from the national budget .\n",
      "S Therefore , helping the aged on financial issues could not be the priority in a country 's policies .\n",
      "S On the other hand , opponents of this position can argue that ther should be filial obligation for the dependence of this grey population on their children .\n",
      "S They were also parents sacrificing their whole life for the children so it is sensible that they are concerned at the end of life .\n",
      "S Since families are the nuclears shaping the society , humans morality should be well educated from these first shells , Nevertheless , it might be more useful for the aged if the pension age is put up or getting more exercise in order to prevent dangerous risks coming with their downgrading bodies .\n",
      "S In fact , Japan ( 2003 ) increased the age of retirement for men from 60 to 65 and from 57 to 65 for women .\n",
      "S As a result , despite the limit on money spending , we still respect traditional responsibilities .\n",
      "S Also , it might be necessary when citizens all act for the common target- the country 's benefits .\n",
      "S Since the grey generation is just one part of a large society , its duty could be reduced for the growth of the whole society .\n",
      "S In conclusion , aging population is a global phenomenon , but it does n't imply that the government should waste too much money on finding a solution .\n",
      "S The elderly people could be a huge expense on the national budget , while there are other significant sectors demanding for more concern from the entire society , In spite of partly against moral aspects , the country 's interest might outweighs the filial obligations .\n",
      "S Instead of using money as the only method , it is highly recommended that changing all our lifestyle for being independent and healthy regardless of the age .\n",
      "S The problem of an aging population has been one of the top agendas in national policies and budgets for many politicians all over the world , especially for Singapore .\n",
      "S In the Budget 2007 , three billion has been earmarked for healthcare spending to deal with the issue .\n",
      "S However , Singapore should limit public spending on the aged because it does not provide a long-term solution for the nation and thus it should be spent on other developments that can indirectly but significantly relieve the economic burden of the aging population .\n",
      "S The other developments include medical science , science and technology and lastly , education .\n",
      "S Proponents claim that the government should implement better policies to alleviate the aging population with increasing public spending on mainly medical benefits because illnesses catch up with them as they grow older and the expensive treatments could possibly wipe out their savings accounts .\n",
      "S Compared to other countries such as USA , Singapore does not have as much money reserves , therefore it is not feasible .\n"

      "S Lastly , public spending on the aged can be diverted to educate the younger generation on financial planning so that they can save enough for their retirement .\n",
      "S Most of the younger generation do not have the habit of saving because they have not been told or taught on how to deal with future obstacles they may face in the later years .\n",

      "S In this way , they will be less dependent on the government in the future .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the government should limit public spending on the aged and focus more on the major future developments which can help Singapore tackle the main problems that the majority of the local population faces , and also the roots of the aging population .\n",

      "S Demographic changes such as a growing aging population will have an unprecedented problem in developed nations .\n",
      "S National budgets and economies will come under pressure as more funds are required to support the growing numbers of elderly persons .\n",

      "S Ministry of Finance ( 2008 ) states that the Government will be contributing $ 226 million to top up Medisave accounts for the elderly .\n",

      "S The government confronts a series of financial and social problems .\n",
      "S The biggest challenge is to reduce the fiscal and economic cost of elder dependency .\n",
      "S Many policies have been proposed by scholars .\n",
      "S The idea that reserving retirement fund in advance can ease the aging process is regarded as an efficient and feasible method to the government ( Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S However , some still think that the younger generation and the government are responsible to deal with the problem coming with aging population .\n",
      "S If elderly people failed to accumulate enough funds before retirement , they have to rely a lot on their children .\n",
      "S However , the younger generation have heavy financial burdens to take care of their own families and sometimes are unable to support their parents .\n",
      "S For example , in a Singaporean middle class family , a young couple usually has two to four children and lives in a governmental or private house with mortgage .\n",
      "S They have to work hard to provide the basic necessities of life , such as food , clothes , education etc .\n",
      "S In this harsh situation , the elderly parents who have no incomes and no savings become a big financial strain to the young .\n",
      "S When the health conditions of the elderly people become bad , the financial burden on the young becomes overwhelming .\n",
      "S In some cases , an expensive medical bill can even lead a prosperous family to bankruptcy .\n",
      "S When the young are exposed to both financial and emotional stresses , they can not concentrate on work .\n",
      "S Finally , it negatively affects the society by decreasing productivity and economic growth .\n",
      "S Some people think that the government has obligation to help the elderly by providing financial aid .\n",
      "S It seems that the young can shift the liability and solve the financial problem , but these excessive government subsidies will result in draining the public purse quickly .\n",
      "S The government has to increase taxes in order to fill vacancies .\n",
      "S Consequently , the tax payers , mainly the younger generation who are productive , will pay even more taxes .\n",
      "S In many European countries , the unemployed people receive unemployment benefits from the government .\n",
      "S On the other hand , the jobholders have to pay more taxes .\n",
      "S High welfare always comes with high taxes .\n",
      "S Relying merely on governmental subsidies does not solve the problem .\n",
      "S On the contrary , the government should compel people to save a certain portion of their incomes into special retirement accounts before they reach retirement age and allow the owners to withdraw the money when they retire .\n",
      "S The government could also give subsidies to encourage the public to do so , for instance , offering a reasonably high interest rate .\n",
      "S Singaporean government has been doing well in this respect .\n",
      "S All Singaporean must save 5 percent of their total incomes and their employers contribute additional 20 percent into a government retirement account .\n",
      "S The government provides a 4 percent annual interest rate which is relatively higher than many commercial banks .\n",
      "S There are two reasons that the Singaporean government to do so .\n",
      "S One is to give confidence to the public ; the other one is to help them to mitigate the effects of inflation .\n",
      "S Most Singaporean are expected to accumulate sufficient amount for retirement with the help of this system .\n",
      "S Aging population is a social problem as well as an individual problem .\n",
      "S The government has responsibility to help and guide the public to plan their retirement life .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the public must take care of themselves .\n",
      "S Providing retirement fund in advance is a long term project and this can only be achieved by raising public consciousness .\n",
      "S Public spending , in terms of taxes , refers to the sum of money charged by the government for specific facilities or services , levied upon incomes , property , sales , and more .\n",
      "S Some of the taxes include Income Tax , Property Tax , as well as Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) .\n",
      "S This strategy suggested is feasible to a large extent .\n",
      "S Public spending should be limited to a certain degree so that budget would be diverted to different areas such as education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system of the country .\n",
      "S The most basic yet important area of the country 's development would be education .\n",
      "S In most countries , education is considered to be one of the fundamental sector that the country 's government can develop and improve on .\n",
      "S It is the base system of the country that imparts knowledge to the people and keeps a majority of them employed .\n",
      "S For that reason , the process of education is considered to be essential for the development our society such that every child has to go through a minimum ten years of basic education .\n",
      "S It has also become such an indispensable part of our lives that to the majority of people , it appears to be a norm to complete the whole process of the education .\n",
      "S It is crucial that the country have a good education system for a better future economic development .\n",
      "S The Research and Development ( R&D ) sector allows the development of the country .\n",
      "S According to the Yearbook of Statistics Singapore , there has been an increase in demand for R&D by many companies .\n",
      "S As changes occur every day , modernization occurs , new technologies are introduced and people try to catch up with the rapid advancement .\n",
      "S In many cases , research and development is important to the countries ' businesses and industries to boost knowledge and skills .\n",
      "S For favorable progress , it is important for the business sector , universities , colleges and research institutes to collaborate in order to stimulate innovation , growth and modernization .\n",
      "S More needs to be done in order to draw us nearer to the fast changing know- how of the society .\n",
      "S The tourism industry attracts foreigners to spend , thus giving rise to an inflow of cash into the country .\n",
      "S To many countries , tourism is their only source of income and is therefore vital for them to develop in this area .\n",
      "S For example , Maldives and Seychelles only earn the opportunity for employment in the tourism service industries .\n",
      "S It includes hospitality services , such as hotels and resorts , transportation services , such as airlines , cruise ships and taxis , as well as entertainment venues , such as shopping malls , amusement parks and casinos .\n",
      "S Thus , government initiatives for the tourism industry are important , to enhance growth throughout the country by promoting the development of the industry and also to increase employment opportunities by creating more jobs available for them .\n",
      "S However , on the other hand , though should be limited , adequate percentage of public spending for the aged should be allocated fairly .\n",
      "S The reason being , many elderly are being neglected by their own children , and thus uninsured .\n",
      "S They might not have enough money to get their regular medical checkups done .\n",
      "S So , does this means that they are to die ?\n",
      "S This problem would continue to get worst every year if there is an inadequate attention paid .\n",
      "S Though it is important to solve the problem of the graying society , we should limit our public spending in this sector so that we can allow more budget on the other aspects of a country 's development , such as the transportation infrastructure .\n",
      "S A significant level of road traffic can be created due to the high density of an urban environment .\n",
      "S This can have a great impact on businesses and environmental factors .\n",
      "S Therefore , careful planning and development of the transportation system are crucial .\n",
      "S More money should be used to develop this infrastructure in order to support the moving of goods from one place to another efficiently and effectively .\n",
      "S Parking space is another concern .\n",
      "S For example , in Singapore where land scarcity poses a big issue , multi-storey carparks are built to allow more vehicles to be parked given the same land area used .\n",
      "S In conclusion , public spending on the aged should be limited to the certain percentage that is adequate for the welfare of the aged .\n",
      "S On top of that , public spending should also be diverted across different aspect of social concerns that lead to the development of Singapore .\n",
      "S By putting a limit for the spending on the aged , we can create more budgets to spend on the education , research and development , tourism industry and transportation system as they are equally important to our nation .\n",

      "S Hence , public spending on the aged in Singapore has a high possibility of rising in order to cope with the shift in aging structure .\n",
      "S However , limitations should be set on the public spending on the aged to a large extent in order to promote the country 's development in other areas .\n",
      "S In Singapore , where there is a reasonably low birth rate and top-notch health care which helps prolong people 's lives , population aging is inevitable , hence being prospective-looking , the strategy that is feasible would be to reallocate of funds and attention on other areas , in particular , Education and Tourism .\n",
      "S The diversion of capital into the Education Sector will enable Singapore to identify more opportunities .\n",
      "S Singapore is presently building an education hub in Asia , investing millions of funds to boost her image and economy .\n",
      "S As foreign students start pouring into Singapore , it is projected that education services will generate about five percent of the gross domestic product .\n",
      "S Moreover , a high quality education system will be beneficial for the next generation , as exhibited by the ripple effect .\n",
      "S The increased education quality will extend an average Singaporean 's working span allowing an increase accumulation of savings .\n",
      "S This will indirectly help to solve some of the problems posed by ageing population , as it will help to reduce elderly dependency and changing Singapore into an independent society where elderly will be less reliant on the government .\n",

      "S The tourism industry posted high revenue of S $ 14.8 billion in 2008 , a 4.8 % increase from 2007 .\n",
      "S This increase has demonstrated the potential of Singapore 's tourism industry and making full use of every opportunity presented in this sector will be vital , owing to the colossal impact this industry has on other industries .\n",

      "S Psychological treatments have helped the elderly to cope with their emotional problems .\n",
      "S People tend to be emotionally unstable when they reach old age .\n",
      "S This is because they feel they are not capable of doing things that they can do when they were still young .\n",
      "S They have problems getting promoted or hired because of their age , and also afraid of being asked to retire earlier , causing them to have work pressure .\n",
      "S Special care that they receive from their family members and the society makes them feel old , and indirectly contributes to their emotional problems .\n",

      "S Most people think that psychological treatments are meant for those who have serious mental problems .\n",
      "S They feel ashamed and choose not to approach psychologists when they are emotionally unstable or depressed .\n",
      "S It is this kind of misconception they possess which causes their mental illness worsen .\n",
      "S A professional person , in this case , the psychologists , can offer help by counselling the elderly and giving them useful advices to encourage them that they are not the group of people who always require special help from the others , and also to let them feel that they are accepted by the society .\n",
      "S Government can help easing the aging process of the elderly through implementation of social policies which encourage later retirement , longer working life and lower barrier for the employment of the elderly ( Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S By working longer , the elderly can accumulate more wealth , which can be used in their post-retirement life .\n",
      "S Some people may say that old people 's working ability starts to decrease when they approach retirement age .\n",
      "S The aging workforce will then decrease the work productivity and lower nation 's economic development .\n",
      "S However , it is proven by John Rowe and Robert Kahn in their study that those who continue to work and participate in social activities after their retirement life are very unlikely to experience physical and mental decline .\n",
      "S There are still a portion of elderly persons who aged successfully .\n",
      "S The working experiences of some elderly individuals can be made good assets to the development of the society .\n",
      "S Therefore , in order to introduce this policy , the government has increased the retirement age of working persons , and has given fewer incentives to fund their after-retirement life , so that they will prolong their working life .\n",
      "S To ease the aging process of the elderly , the government has also introduced and encouraged the need for working individuals to prepare a fund for their future use .\n",
      "S The private savings funds and investment plans may be optional , but the government implemented one should be mandated , so that every retired citizen will have a secured fund for their post-retirement use .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) has been introduced to provide the working Singaporeans with a sense of security and confidence in their life after retirement .\n",

      "S Some people may think that the saving plans will only benefit those who earn more .\n",

      "S In conclusion , psychological treatments such as counselling and also the implementation of government 's social policies have helped to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Although it has become an arising issue that the aging population will bring a great impact to the society and also the economic growth of the country , more emphasis should be given to the older generation , as they are important assets to the nation .\n",

      "S Currently , there are policies implemented to help the aging population in three different areas , physical , emotional and financial .\n",
      "S First , elderly have weaker health and are more susceptible to chronic illnesses .\n",
      "S Medisave policy is introduced to aid in healthcare needs such as paying hospitalization expenses and selected outpatient treatments .\n",
      "S Next , to meet the elderly needs of emotional support , the government implemented additional grants on HDB housing to foster family bonding .\n",
      "S To illustrate , if couples are staying near or together with their parents , they have priority over regular applicants when they apply for new HDB flat .\n",
      "S Similarly , those buying resale flats benefit from a higher housing grant , approximately an additional of 10,000 dollar .\n",
      "S In this way , it enables the young to continuously get in touch with their parents .\n",
      "S Moreover , the elderly can help to take care of their children , if any .\n",
      "S Last , elderly loss income on retirement , therefore , they have to depend on their savings or children for their expenses .\n",
      "S In cases where elderly can not support themselves financially and their children refuse to take care of them , Maintenance of Parents Act had been implemented in 1996 .\n",
      "S Consequently , parents can demand financial maintenance from their children through family court .\n",
      "S On the contrary , \" elderly will use between three and five times more health-care services compared to younger generation \" ( Straits Times , 2007 ) , thus Medisave would be still inadequate to assist most of the elderly in their course of aging .\n",
      "S Besides , Medisave can be easily drained especially on chronic illnesses , which can tote up to a huge amount .\n",
      "S Furthermore , women of older generation in Singapore had particularly low average incomes because they received lesser education .\n",
      "S As a result , the amount of money in their Medisave will be very limited .\n",
      "S Moreover , most of the aged Singaporeans are not insured by anything else .\n",
      "S In essence , most of the old remains incapable to afford their medical expenses despite with the help of Medisave .\n",
      "S Next , HDB housing policy is only feasible for family that values filial piety .\n",
      "S According to Mr. Gerard Ee , chairman of Council for Third Age , it is progressively common for younger generation to abandon their aged parents .\n",
      "S Besides , for couples who purchase a house near their parents , they may not have time due to hectic work schedule and family commitments .\n",
      "S Thus , staying near their aging parents does not equate to giving them the desired emotional support .\n",
      "S In additional , elderly will need friends to talk to and at the same time to accompany them .\n",
      "S In this way , it can keep them socially active thus , feeling valued .\n",
      "S Lastly , the policy on Maintenance of Parents Act remains highly ineffective to seek children to support their parents for four different groups .\n",
      "S First , the sandwiched generation that is expected to take care of their children and their aging parents and on top of that to manage the increasing standard of living .\n",
      "S Hence , the breadwinners would find it difficult to cope with their own needs and support their growing children and aging parents .\n",
      "S Second , majority of the aging parent is not willing to resort to the law to receive financial maintenance because they do not want to further strain the relationship with their children .\n",
      "S Next , the law is not applicable for children who are overseas and their aging parents are all alone here .\n",
      "S Finally , a large family when merely one child takes the main bulk of care giving duties of their aged parents .\n",
      "S In brief , the current Maintenance of Parents Act alone is not sufficient to help the elderly to be financially dependent .\n",
      "S All in all , the current policies benefit minority of the aging population .\n",
      "S Most of the elderly still remains vulnerable to the aging process and improvements can be made to create a less painful process .\n",
      "S For instance , government can lighten the aged burden of medical expenses by subsidizing one of the visits to the polyclinic for an amount up to a hundred dollar every six months .\n",
      "S In any case , for any policies to be effective , government have to continuously revise them by analyzing the current situation and making adjustments to the policies accordingly .\n",
      "S Government must not forget to consider whether they are putting too heavy a burden on the current generation .\n",
      "S To summarize , a balance must strike between responsibility of individual , government and their family members .\n",
      "S Populations in many developed nations are facing a demographic time bomb in the form of an ageing population , and Singapore is no exception .\n",
      "S This is largely due to the fact that Singapore encountered a baby boom between 1947 and 1964 and thereafter , people started to have fewer children .\n",
      "S The baby boomers are generally better educated , richer and healthier as they were the beneficiaries of a developing education system and the predecessors of industrialization and the primary contributors of Singapore 's economic growth .\n",
      "S Hence , they enjoy a longer life span which resulted in a demographic shift in Singapore today .\n",
      "S A phenomenon as such would have repercussions on the economy and society .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges of an ageing population through implementing programs which involve expenditure by the government .\n",
      "S Such expenditure is known as public spending .\n",
      "S However , as Singapore aims to be a world-class city , the government should not only focus its expenditure on the aged but also on other areas of development such as development projects and education .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should be limited in terms of healthcare and eldercare services , housing and accessibility .\n",
      "S Firstly , it is important for the government to finance healthcare and eldercare services as it is inevitable that people fall ill and frail as they get older .\n",
      "S By 2030 , one in five Singaporean residents will be aged 65 years and above .\n",
      "S Thus , the government should seek to construct more healthcare and eldercare facilities as the current number of healthcare institutions such as hospitals and nursing homes may be insufficient to cater to the increasing needs of the population .\n",
      "S With an increase in healthcare facilities , the government has to ensure that there are sufficient skilled healthcare service providers through implementing training programs and introduce incentives to attract skilled foreign labour .\n",
      "S Secondly , the government should execute schemes and regulations to ensure that housing is affordable for the elderly .\n",
      "S In the United States , sharp increases in the housing costs fueled by rising urban land prices have created difficulties for the elderly to afford housing and this resulted in an increase in the number of homeless .\n",
      "S Thirdly , the government should construct elder-friendly facilities such as lifts in every HDB flat to restrict hindered access from homes to public amenities , communal and recreational facilities for the aged .\n",
      "S Even though it is essential for the government to allocate public spending on the aged since the effects of the ageing population will impact the national economy and society , unlimited funding on the aged may have negative implications on the economy .\n",
      "S By 2030 , the number of elderly in Singapore will increase to 18.7 % and the number of working persons supporting one elderly person will decrease to 3.5 persons .\n",
      "S These statistics have proven that population aging is enduring and this mean that tackling the challenges that come along with it is a long term process for the government and government spending on the aged will continue to increase .\n",
      "S Hence , unlimited funding instead of proper allocation of public spending on the aged may drain the economy .\n",
      "S Since a primary source of revenue for public spending comes from taxation , the government will have to increase the tax rates in order to finance its unlimited spending on the ageing population .\n",
      "S This may lead to unhappiness in and weariness of the working population especially given that the number of working persons supporting an elderly has decreased .\n",
      "S High levels of taxation may also lead to a decrease in domestic and foreign investments .\n",
      "S Unlimited funding may discourage people from staying employed and accumulating savings to see them through their old age as they may have the tendency to rely on the benefits provided by the government .\n",
      "S Unemployment will cause the workforce to shrink and result in an economic slowdown .\n"

      "S According to the Singapore Tourism Board , in 2006 , Singapore achieved a record of 9.7 million visitors , compared to 8.9 million in 2005 .\n",
      "S An estimated sum of $ 12.4 billion was spent .\n",
      "S Singapore hopes to achieve a record of 17 million visitors by the year 2015 .\n",
      "S With such high volume of tourists , more hotel rooms are required to accommodate them .\n",
      "S Strong competition from the region also requires Singapore to be unique from its neighbouring countries .\n",
      "S With no natural attractions and little resources , Singapore has no choice but to create man-made attractions such as resorts and casinos , or coming up with attractions that is only attractive to foreigners .\n",
      "S Such attractions require large amounts of money .\n",
      "S However , the benefits outweighs the negatives as it helps to create more jobs and attract foreign investors to invest in its thriving tourism which will help boost the country 's GDP .\n",
      "S Education is also a very important development in a Global City .\n",
      "S The lack of education is one of the problems that elderly face in today society , thus leading to poor financial management .\n",
      "S As Singapore is small and does n't have any natural resources , it is shaping its economy into a knowledge-based economy .\n",
      "S In order to achieve such goals , more resources should be pumped into the education system , such as providing additional funds to needy students , which allows them to break out of their poverty cycle ; improving the infrastructures of schools and universities ; and recruiting more teachers .\n",
      "S With a better education system , it allows Singaporeans to enter the workforce with better skills and increases their employability , thus preventing the problems that current elderly are facing now .\n",
      "S Housing is also another major issue that Singapore faces .\n",
      "S Singapore currently has a population of slightly more than 4 million people .\n",
      "S The average population density is about 6814 per km ² , thus it is one of the most crowded cities in the world .\n",
      "S To cope with the increasing population , more high-rise residential buildings known as HDB flats are built .\n",
      "S These flats are heavily subsidised by the government to make it affordable .\n",
      "S More money should be invested in older flats , such as providing upgrades to the current facilities to improve the quality of life of citizens living in such areas .\n",
      "S Public spending on the elderly should not be removed .\n",
      "S However the government may have to consider limiting it .\n",
      "S Without limiting , it will cause over dependence on the government , worsening the current situation in the near future .\n",
      "S If public spending is allocated on areas such as housing , education and tourism , the new generation will be more financially secure than their parents .\n"

      "S It will also help Singaporeans to stay ahead and be competitive in terms of employability and marketability , furthermore contributing to the country 's GDP growth which helps in the overall country development in the long term .\n",
      "S In 2007 , one of Financial Times 's reporters once mentioned that with the low fertility rate and an increased in life expectancy , Singapore would soon have only 2.2 workers to support each elderly person [ i ] .\n",
      "S With such a low number of working adults to support the elderly , there would be a need for the government to at least remain at its current expenditure on the aged .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending on the aged should not be overly limited .\n",
      "S Though public spending should be used fully on the aged , there are other areas of concern that the government money should divert to , such as the healthcare system .\n",
      "S Recently , Singapore Prime Minister , Mr Lee Hsein Loong , had stressed the need for step down care system [ ii ] during his National Day Rally Speech for the nation 's 44th birthday .\n",
      "S The step-down care system requires Singapore acute hospital to link with community hospitals [ iii ] , this , in turn , will enable long term illness patient to enjoy a suitable care while saving money on hospital fees .\n",
      "S As the community hospitals charge less .\n",
      "S However , Singapore should not make use of budget for the aged to improvise other areas .\n",
      "S This is because Singapore will be suffering from aging population by the time it reaches year 2030 .\n",
      "S If public spending for the aged is not well utilised for the next few years , Singapore will be having problems when the time comes .\n",
      "S Though government had encouraged children in fulfilling filial obligations of taking care of their parents , with their own family to take care of , children of these elderly would not be able to bare the financial burden .\n",
      "S This further emphasizes the need for a helping hand .\n",
      "S For the past decades , Singapore government had been emphasizing the value of self reliance on its citizen despite the economic ups and downs .\n",
      "S Policies , such as the Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , had been implemented to ensure that Singaporeans are able to support themselves after retirement .\n",
      "S However , recently , many found that the amount is insufficient to keep up with the rising cost of medical fees , resulting in the use of the children 's CPF account .\n",
      "S Currently , the common age group of children , whose parents are elderly , are in their late 40s or early 50s , and it is common that the children 's CPF account is emptied because of the hefty medical bills .\n",
      "S If this vicious cycle continues , the future generation will suffer .\n",
      "S An extreme example would be the grandfather uses and depletes the CPF account of the parents , and when the children grow and their parents suffer from long term illness , such as diabetes , they may use their CPF account if they do not have sufficient cash on-hand .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government should not limit their public spending on the aged .\n",
      "S In the above paragraph , the vicious cycle occurs when the elderly depends on her children but what will happen to the elderly if the children refuse to fulfil their filial obligations .\n",
      "S As a matter of fact , these old folks will be left on their own , with the support from welfare organisations .\n",
      "S However , for most cases , welfare organisations can only help to the extent of getting daily necessities for them .\n",
      "S When it comes to financial assistance , the welfare organisation , too , will have difficulty in helping the elderly .\n",

      "S This , therefore , requires a further assistance from their next supporting pillar : the government .\n",
      "S Though decades of self-reliance had taught Singaporeans to stand firm and learnt to support themselves and their family solely , now they can no longer do so .\n",
      "S With the rising cost of medical facilities , elderly with the supports of their children could longer rely on their own CPF accounts and their children income to pay the fees .\n",

      "S As the saying goes \" Time and tide wait for no man \" , ageing is an inevitable process one has to face .\n",

      "S ( Illnesses of The Elderly , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Moreover , one will become physically weak as one aged and this will lead a higher tendency to cause a lesion in oneself .\n",
      "S Thus , accessibility in the built environment is especially crucial as the number of people with mobility difficulties will increase significantly over the next 25 years in Singapore ( BCA , 2009 & An Ageing Population Calls for Restructure of Healthcare System , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S This leads to a sudden need of facilities and technologies to cater for this particular group .\n",
      "S Consequently , the government has implemented several policies to lessen the burden of ageing process while researchers have come up with brilliant inventions to increase the convenience and comfort level for the majority .\n",
      "S To put it simply , the technological inventions ' researches and architectural policies have helped to ease the ageing process to a great extent in terms of convenience and comfort level .\n",
      "S However , the alleviation of ageing process is putting a strain on users ' pockets financially even though the introduction of the facilities benefits them in term of comfort and convenience .\n",
      "S To illustrate , although the Lift Upgrading Programme ( LUP ) that is introduced in Singapore is heavily subsidised by the government and the Town Councils , the beneficiaries are still required to pay a large sum in order to enjoy the benefits .\n",
      "S The maximum amount which the flat owners have to pay is capped at $ 3,000 ( HDB , 2006 ) , and this amount is not a diminutive amount .\n",
      "S Although the residents have to pay to enjoy the benefits of convenience , the amount of benefits enjoyed by the residents are definitely more than the value that they have to fork out , in terms of long-term usage .\n",
      "S Seeing that , the policies or acts that were implemented under Building Construction Authority ( BCA ) and Housing Development Board ( HDB ) have improved the standard of living for the people .\n",
      "S The BCA states that \" a $ 40-million Accessibility Fund had been set aside to upgrade buildings built before 1990 .\n",
      "S This fund is also used to upgrade all key areas and essential facilities in Singapore to provide at least essential accessibility by 2011 \" ( BCA , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Under this scheme , the LUP is introduced and it is designed to improve the flat 's access and personal convenience by the Singapore government in 2001 ( HDB , 2006 ) .\n",
      "S Since lifts in HDB blocks that were built before 1990 are not providing 100 % access to every level , any existing building under Housing Development Board ( HDB , 2006 ) will be altered and added with lifts that stop at every floor .\n",
      "S This change has made a significant change to the residents , especially elders who are physically weak .\n",
      "S Thus , there will be no need for them to climb the staircase which they might have the tendency to fall when using it .\n",
      "S Other than the LUP , Singapore government has also inputted public ramps to ease elders from climbing the stairs under the same scheme .\n",
      "S These strategies have aided in easing the ageing process effectively .\n",
      "S To give an example , The Straits Times on 31 August 2009 , reported that two new ramps , a covered shelter connecting the 20-year-old station to the nearest bus stop in Yishun Avenue 2 , as well as an additional drop-off point have been constructed for the elderly residents living at Nee Soon South , where it housed approximately 50,000 elderly residents ( The Straits Times , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .\n",
      "S On the contrary , with the alteration made to the flats , the elders might rely too much on the lifts rather than using the staircase which could be the only form of exercises for them .\n",
      "S Thus , the convenience might unintentionally exacerbate the health of one being due to the lack of exercises .\n",
      "S Due to the fact that negative effects occur when one is too dependent on the usage of facilities , the town council has solved this problem by building Fitness Parks for elders to exercise to maintain a healthy body .\n",
      "S Moreover , the elders would have a more conducive place for them to do exercises as well as to treat it as a place for gathering .\n",
      "S Hence , the government policies with regard to architecture have helped to ease the ageing process effectively .\n",
      "S Besides that , other countries such as Japan that is facing ageing population problems have spent hefty amount on researching and testing on technologies to create healthy lifestyle products and medical equipment .\n",
      "S Therefore , the end products produced in terms of medical and lifestyle products will be costly and unaffordable to purchase for those financially weak elders and thus , not many elders will be enjoying the benefits .\n"

      "S Firstly , social policy has helped to ease the aging process as the financial burden of the aged has been reduced to ensure that all needy elderly patients are able to afford and receive basic treatments .\n",
      "S This is achieved when the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) put forth a sum of money in the way of Medifund Silver so that it can serve as the last resort for those who still can not afford the medical fee despite the subsidies that were offered by the government or other charitable organizations .\n",

      "S As the population age , it is more difficult for them to work as efficiently as before and their market value also falls .\n",
      "S In addition , the elderly are more likely to suffer from health issues and incur high medical cost .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is important for them to build up a financial reserve to support themselves in their aging process .\n",
      "S Despite the introduction of these policies , there are still some elderly who are excluded in these schemes .\n",
      "S Some elderly women have remained a housewife for decades and they have not worked in the workforce before thus there is no contribution to her CPF account .\n",
      "S In this case , it is dependent on oneself to save from the money she receives to support her in the future .\n",
      "S This is especially true for those who do odd jobs where the employers do not help to contribute to their CPF account .\n",
      "S Although the current social policies can help to build up the financial capability of the aging population and make their aging process easier , there remain a group unprotected .\n",
      "S Nonetheless , the government has also introduced the Interim Disability Assistance Programme for the Elderly ( IDAPE ) , a government assistance scheme providing financial help to needy and disabled elderly Singaporeans , who are not eligible for ElderShield because of their age or pre-existing disabilities .\n",
      "S The government also recognize the heavy cost of elderly patients who require immediate and long-term care ( ILTC ) services as they are admitted for a long period of time .\n",
      "S Thus , government subsidies are given based on the patient 's eligibility and financial status .\n",
      "S Therefore , the different social policies are introduced to complement one another so as to ensure the entire aging population receives a form of financial support when they are in need .\n",
      "S As such , it is possibly true to say that the current social policies can indeed help to ease the aging process to a large degree .\n",
      "S In conclusion , the aging process is indeed one that is difficult to cope with but with the current medical technologies and a wide range of social policies and reforms the elderly are more protected .\n",
      "S The policies intends to cater to benefit as many aged as possible and thus it is possibly true to say that the technologies and the policies have helped the majority of aging population to cope with their problems more effectively today .\n",
      "S The advance of technology and science has brought both opportunities and challenges to our society .\n",
      "S One of the difficulties is the increasing life expectancy , the result of considerable life quality 's improvement , which leads to the growing burden on economics in developed countries over the years .\n",
      "S Adequate preparation and judicious policies are musts to ensure the sustainable and stable social progress in this baby-boomer transition period .\n",
      "S The appropriate financial need scheme and the retirement saving fund from individuals is one of the six fundamental approaches for demographic-transform-based policy planning ( Peter G. Peterson , fall 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Based on Singapore context , veterans ' retirement saving scheme is a feasible solution to ease the aging issue but there are still some troubles needed to be carefully analysed .\n",
      "S The Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) in Singapore is inclusive social saving plan that require savings from the labour force in order to prepare better for aging population in retirement , health care , home ownership and family protection in the future .\n",
      "S The fact that it may cause serious troubles for financial resources and caring from young generation when the aging population changes rapidly urges people to alter the way they support themselves .\n",
      "S For example , by 2030 , only 3.5 economically active persons will be supporting one elderly whereas the number now is 10 in Singapore .\n",
      "S ( Singapore CPF Board , 2009 ) In addition , Singapore 's aging population might decrease 3 percentage segment of long-term economic growth and the elderly support programme from Government could cost more than 7 % of GDP according to the recent national report .\n",
      "S Therefore , employees and employers are asked to make personal contributions and supplements to CPF which includes involvement from public sector , corporate fund , industry fund , retail fund and small fund from financially sophisticated people .\n",
      "S Having the fastest demographic change , but by applying the sensible planning and policies , currently , Singapore 's CPF achieves the highest exposure than any other retirement plan in Asia and adds from 16.3 to 30.4 % to Gross National savings rate .\n",
      "S ( Asher , 1995 ) Alleviating the aging structure , the contributions to these savings are deductible in Singapore as the Governments aim to basic needs and medical expenses security and stability for aging population .\n",
      "S Therefore , Singaporean citizens will be more sensibly confident and well prepared for their old age when they have financial guarantee for retirement years .\n",
      "S However , more effort need to be put into strategic planning for bridging the retirement saving gaps as this , basically , is a method of short-term saving on one generation perspective only .\n"

      "S However , public spending for education does not only have to be for the young .\n",
      "S The elderly can also be educated on how to take better care of themselves , reducing their dependency on the society and help them ease the aging process .\n",
      "S People today are less willing to have children , which resulted in low birth rate .\n",
      "S There is a need for government to spend on \" baby boomer \" campaigns .\n",
      "S For instance , Singapore government came up with a Baby Bonus scheme to supports working adults ' decision to have more children by helping to lighten their financial costs of raising children .\n",
      "S According to the Baby Bonus scheme ( 2009 , August,4 ) , \" A cash gift of up to $ 4,000 each for the 1st and 2nd child and $ 6,000 each for the 3rd and 4th child .\n",
      "S All children born on or after 17 August 2008 will also enjoy government contributions in the form of a dollar-for-dollar matching for the amount of savings contribute to the child 's Children Development Account ( CDA ) \" .\n",
      "S Currently , these policies are not working as well as the government 's expectations , seeing that the future generation in an ageing population is essential , public spending would be needed to intensify these campaigns so as to improve its efficiency .\n",
      "S However , there is of course a need to have a certain amount of spending on the elderly .\n",
      "S The problems of the elderly these days are issues of abandonment .\n",
      "S Hence what we can do is to spend on campaigns which emphasize on the social value of the elderly .\n",
      "S With their experiences and stories , by sharing them with the society , humanity is implemented into people as they learn the hardships of the elderly in the process of bringing them up to the position they are in presently .\n",
      "S Thus , these elderly campaigns encourage three generation families living together , solving problems of abandonment .\n",

      "S Regarding issues of elderly illnesses and recreation , there are actually adequate facilities for them .\n",

      "S But the controversy of the elderly abilities to generate more wealth in comparison to the remunerative younger working adults had deterred many private companies .\n",
      "S In consequence , the government have to provide funding for these companies to encourage them to retain their elderly workers .\n",
      "S But this move is viable as the vast knowledge and experiences that these elderly had gained over the years of working in the company serves as excellent mentors for the younger generations .\n",
      "S This will in turn generate more economical benefits for the companies .\n",
      "S Besides it also allows the accumulation of more wealth for the elderly to be more self-sufficient after they retire .\n",
      "S This two tier solution would definitely help in the progress of a country .\n",
      "S In addition , the introduction of health related welfare schemes for the aged is also one of the main solutions .\n",
      "S It provides a sense of financial security for the elderly as high medical cost would be highly subsidised .\n",
      "S This would lengthen the ability of the elderly to be self-sufficient throughout their golden years .\n",
      "S As a result , it helps to reduce the reliance on the public welfare schemes , allowing a more generative used of the funds in other aspects of the country .\n",
      "S But on the other hand , there are also other important areas that that public spending could be used upon to facilitate the country 's development .\n",
      "S For instance , investing in the lucrative tourism industry would generate a lot more wealth for the country .\n",
      "S This will allow additional financial inputs for the country to tap upon to provide greater welfare benefits for its citizens .\n",
      "S Besides , focus could also be placed upon the education for the younger generation .\n",
      "S Equipping the students with the essential technical skills would require a considerable amount of funds .\n",
      "S However , considering the future financial inputs that these well-equipped workforces would generate , it would prove that it is a worthwhile investment for the country .\n",
      "S Finally , all in all a country should deal closely with the issues of an aging population .\n",
      "S This is because it is a problem that is here to stay .\n",
      "S Being flexible to the limitations of funds and not rigidly capping the maximum spending , will allow more room for greater variations of solutions to be carried out .\n",
      "S And in addition , there is not a need to neglect the developments of other areas of investments as the dual approach of slowing down the process of aging population and the improvements in other areas of the society will bring about a quantum leap to the country 's development .\n",
      "S Aging does not mean that the population 's age is reaching a certain big number .\n",
      "S It means when people get older , they are less healthy and their working capacity decreases .\n",
      "S Since aging process has given the country 's economy much burden on developing , which comes from elders ' limit of working age , medical science has made some anti-aging researches on increasing people 's strength and reducing old age 's coming due to the hope of increasing people 's working capacity .\n",

      "S The percentage of residents aged 65 and above has increased from 6.8 % in 1998 to 8.7 % in 2008 ( Population in brief , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S This is expected to reach 20 % in 2030 ( Statement by Ms. Audrey Seah , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , measures for aiding the increasing aging population in terms of healthcare subsidies and daily expenditures are to be proactively prepared .\n",
      "S Some strategies can be introduced to deal with the aging population .\n",
      "S Firstly , greater productivity should be encouraged with the younger generation to be cost-efficient and productive .\n",
      "S Secondly , filial obligation should be stressed among the younger generation .\n",
      "S Lastly , people could be encouraged to have proactive savings when they are secured with a job to save up for the rainy days ( Peter G. Peterson , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , the aging population is not an insurmountable problem , funds could be sub-divided for the expenditure in other sectors such as education , tourism and Research and Development ( R&D ) .\n",
      "S Firstly , education is one of the most important aspects in Singapore as it secures the future of the younger generation .\n",
      "S Singapore has institutions with outstanding records of interactive learning and a bilingual education system .\n",
      "S At tertiary level , locally leading universities are such as the National University of Singapore ( NUS ) , and the Nanyang Technological University ( NTU ) .\n",
      "S Funds are constantly pumped into the education system for the financing of students and also for constant improvements of the education system .\n",

      "S Therefore , by investing in the education sector , the future of the younger generation will be secured .\n",
      "S In turn , they would be able to support the aged thus reducing the dependency of the aged on the government .\n",
      "S Secondly , the tourism sector is a revenue generator for Singapore through the various tourist attractions such as Sentosa and the upcoming Integrated Resorts .\n",
      "S Hence , funds have to be constantly injected for new tourist attractions and contingency plans in the case of an economy crisis .\n",
      "S For example , in February 2009 , the Singapore Tourism Board announced that an incentive of $ 90 million has been provided for the BOOST ( Building On Opportunities to Strengthen Tourism ) which is targeted at aiding the tourism sector in times of challenges ( Singapore Tourism Board , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , funds are essential to ensure that the tourism sector is filled with vibrant attractions and is prepared for any crisis .\n",
      "S This ensures a constant flow of revenue for the economic stability of Singapore .\n",
      "S Lastly , R&D is extensively utilized with various purposes such as major institution projects , innovation and creativity in new developments and for environmental concerns .\n",
      "S For example , R&D is supported with the National Research Foundation which focuses into areas such as the Environmental and Water Technologies and the Interactive and Digital Media .\n",
      "S A total of $ 1.55 billion is invested in these areas ( Singapore Budget , 2009 ) .\n",

      "S In contrast , schemes such as the Central Provident Fund and the Medisave schemes do cover a large proportion of expenses .\n",
      "S Hence , funds spent on the aged should be limited in order to accommodate for the high expenses in the three sectors that contribute a large proportion of revenue to the economy .\n",
      "S In conclusion , R&D brings about innovation and inventions , hence bringing various business opportunities and revenue to Singapore .\n",
      "S On the whole , the aging population is not insurmountable problem .\n",
      "S Hence , public spending on the aged should be limited in order for funds to be sub-divided among the education , tourism and the R&D sectors which are the main sources of revenue .\n",
      "S In turn , with more revenue being generated , more benefits and financial aids could be provided to the aged which benefits the country as a whole .\n"

      "S Hence , it is essential to limit the public spending on the elderly , so more money can be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S The most essential thing to do is to set spending limits on healthcare .\n",

      "S Lastly , developments in medicine have also helped in the ageing process .\n",
      "S With new technological advances , the elderly now have a variety of medical treatments for most old-age related illnesses .\n",
      "S For example , advances in surgery have helped developed a non-invasive surgery technique for glaucoma , one of the main leading causes of blindness , in which the elderly are at a higher risk of contracting .\n",
      "S This non-invasive technique will help to minimize any potential surgical risks .\n",
      "S One impending problem with such rapid technological advances in medicine would be the rising costs of healthcare , brought about by the intensive research processes to develop new cures and treatments .\n",
      "S With most of the elderly retired and no source of income , they might be unable to fund their medical expenses should the need arise .\n",
      "S In view of this , the Singaporean government has in place a variety of measures to minimise the occurrence of this situation .\n",
      "S One such measure would be Medisave .\n",
      "S Introduced by the Ministry of Health in 1984 , Medisave would set aside a portion of an individual 's income to their account , which will be available to fund medical expenses should the need arise .\n",
      "S With this fund , most Singaporeans will go into retirement with a sum of money collected from their working life which can be used to pay for medical expenses .\n",
      "S This reduces the possible reliance of public funds for funding of medical expenses for the elderly , which might result in taxpayers shouldering a larger burden of the alderfly 's medical expenses .\n",
      "S In conclusion , this article has illustrated that the current policies in Singapore have helped ease the ageing process to a large extent .\n",
      "S As shown , policies such as CPF , raising the retirement age and the development of healthcare policies have helped to ease the ageing process in the society , thereby reducing the societal effects of an ageing population .\n",

      "S The great advances in medical technology over the years resulted in the improvements in the health conditions of individuals , and hence the reduced likelihood of them contracting life-threatening diseases .\n",
      "S The life expectancy of individuals has increased due to better accessibility to healthcare services and facilities than before .\n",
      "S In countries such as Singapore , the existence of an ageing population is attributed by the baby boom period after World War II , and the persistently low fertility rate ever since 1970s ( Chan 2001 ) .\n",
      "S As such , this has increase the need for public spending on the aged in order to fund for the needs of the elderly , such as the construction of the elderly facilities and healthcare subsidies .\n",
      "S It could be argued that public spending on the aged is carried out at the expense of a country 's development in other areas , such as education which will increase the productivity of a country , and also infrastructure and transport facilities which serve as attractions for foreign direct investments .\n",
      "S However , Jenson ( 2007 ) reported that it is inevitable that individuals have a higher tendency to consume more healthcare services as they age despite the reduced susceptibility to diseases .\n",
      "S Thus , it is not practical to limit the public spending on the aged such that the money can be used alternatively for a country 's developments .\n",
      "S It is unethical to embark on the developments of a country at the expense of the aged .\n",
      "S By limiting the fiscal spending on the elderly , the extra funds created can be diverted to areas such as education , which has potential long-term benefits for a country .\n",
      "S As such , it will be even tougher for the government to cater to the growing needs of the elderly due to a budget constraint , and this problem will most likely pertain to countries in face of a persisting ageing population , such as Japan .\n",
      "S Opponents of this position argued that there is no need to divert too many resources to the elderly because they no longer contribute to the society upon their retirement .\n",
      "S Instead , these resources should be used in other areas that provide long-term benefits to the country .\n",
      "S For instance , the investing of funds for research and development will raise the productive capacity of the country , thereby attracting more foreign direct investments .\n",
      "S However , it is wrong to regard the aged as a burden , because the aged is a national asset who should not be neglected by the society .\n",
      "S Even after they have retired , they still do contribute the society but it is just done by a different mean , such as taking care of their grandchildren on behalf of their children who are out at work .\n",
      "S In this way , they help to coordinate the work life and family life of the working adults .\n",
      "S ( Conference of European Churches 2007 ) Consequently , the aged , as well as their insights and experiences , is a valuable asset to the society and thus the public spending on the aged should not be limited .\n",
      "S Additionally , the limit of public spending on the elderly might increase the financial burden of the future generations .\n",
      "S This setback is particularly pertinent in countries challenged by an ageing population with low fertility rate and low retired to working population .\n",
      "S In the past , there are usually three or more children in a family .\n",
      "S The filial obligation to provide financial support for the parents is thus shared among the few children .\n",
      "S As for now , most families have at most two children .\n",
      "S This could be due to factors such as the increased women participation rate in the workforce , later marriages , and the increase financial costs of having children .\n",
      "S As a result , the filial obligation placed a greater weight on children from these families .\n",
      "S In the future to come , the ageing population might worsen if low fertility rate persists .\n",
      "S Inter-Ministerial Committee on Aging Report ( 1999 ) states that in 1999 , 7.3 % of the population comprises of older Singaporeans aged 65 and above , and it is expected that they will make up 19 % of the population by 2030 .\n",
      "S Some critics might argue that the country will lag behind and lose its competitiveness if the fiscal spending on the elderly is not limited .\n",
      "S They perceived public spending on the aged as a form of liability to a country because such spending brings no future benefits to the country , and cause the country to neglect its development in essential areas , such as infrastructure and transport facilities , which serve as a pulling force for foreign direct investments .\n",
      "S Thus , if the limit is not imposed , the economy of a country will be adversely affected in the long run .\n",
      "S However , instead of limiting fiscal spending on the aged , there are alternatives that can similarly improve the productivity of a country .\n",
      "S For instance , when older workers are retrained , they can be as productive as a young worker prior to their experience , and this also increases their employability .\n",
      "S Alternatively , there should be adjustments on fiscal spending on the aged based on their percentage in the country 's population .\n",
      "S All these constitute a win-win situation which proves that public spending on the aged should not be limited .\n",
      "S Lastly , the limiting of public spending on the aged will increase the financial hardship of the elderly .\n",
      "S This is faced by the elderly who are either single or have no children , and it is made worse for elderly who have low educational level .\n",
      "S In their younger days , their earnings might just be sufficient for them to cope with their daily living expenses and hence they have negligible or no savings .\n",
      "S When they fall ill , the high costs of medical fees discouraged them from seeking medical care , and as a result , their health conditions deteriorated over time .\n",
      "S As they aged , they became more susceptible to diseases , such as osteoporosis .\n"

      "S However , the presence of a fiscal crisis might not necessarily be attributed by the fiscal spending on the aged .\n",

      "S With an increasing number of Singaporeans belonging to the golden age group of sixty-five years old and above , and an expanding grey population , Singapore needs to deal with the financial challenges of an aging population .\n",
      "S Aging population , an end result of the decreasing fertility rate and the longer life expectancy of baby boomers , will certainly affect Singapore 's economy .\n",
      "S Although the net impact on the Singapore government 's financial position is unsure , public spending on the aged should not be limited in Singapore and should vary accordingly to the situations that Singapore faced as it is clear that expenditures in some areas will increase with aging .\n",
      "S Not limiting the public spending in this case represents that the spending will be a certain amount of percentage pegged to the gross domestic product of Singapore and is subjected to changes due to the following reasons .\n",
      "S Population in Singapore is increasing yearly and aging rapidly ( Singapore Department of Statistics , 2008 ) .\n",
      "S Public spending on the aged should fluctuate according to the composition of the old-aged citizens within the population of Singapore .\n",
      "S The public spending on the old-aged should not be limited such that the limitation is based on the of old-age population five to ten years back .\n",
      "S The public spending should reflect the current composition of the old-aged citizens within the Singapore population .\n",
      "S Conversely , others might argue that by not limiting the public spending on aged means that lesser budget will be allocated to other areas of Singapore 's development such as education , defence and health sectors .\n",
      "S This would cripple the economy of Singapore , which already affected by the aging population as well as shrinking workforce , further as more money will be spent on the aged at the expense of the other developments of Singapore .\n",
      "S However , by spending more on the aged do not necessary denote that budget spend on the development of Singapore will be affected .\n",
      "S This is because the public spending could come from the surpluses Singapore has or accumulated over the years .\n",
      "S Therefore , without limitation on the spending on the aged do not necessary mean that other area of Singapore 's development will be crowded out .\n",
      "S Old-aged citizens will bring along different illnesses and diseases where spending will be required for basic healthcare and treatment .\n",
      "S According to the National Institute of Aging ( 2007 ) , experts predicted that there will be a huge raise in disability resulted from increases in age-related chronic disease in all regions of the world .\n",
      "S This implies that public spending should not be limited as it will be required to subsidise the costly healthcare expenses .\n",
      "S This is because the old-age population will not be able to afford the financial burden for the recurrent treatment of their illnesses .\n",
      "S Truly , old-aged citizens accounted for greater than 40 % of the total hospitalisation days in the public sector hospitals in 2006 ( Ministry of Heath , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S On the other hand , it is fortunate that the Singapore Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , which is the fundamental pillar of our social security framework for the old-aged , lend itself readily to provide citizens for the needs of aging population .\n",
      "S Healthcare in Singapore are made affordable through the administration of the Medisave , Medishield and Medifund framework .\n",
      "S Each citizen CPF account consists of medisave , medishield and medifund , which helps individuals to put aside portion of their income to meet their medical expenses especially when they are old .\n",
      "S The medisave accounts assist older Singaporeans pay for or subsidise part of their expensive medical bills .\n",
      "S This would help to ease the public spending on the aged and money can be spent on other area of Singapore 's development .\n",
      "S However , Singaporeans still enjoy heavy subsidies in public hospital , especially in the lower class wards .\n",
      "S Direct subsidies borne by the Singapore government have increased from $ 850 million in 2001 to more than $ 1.6 billion in 2007 and are forecasted to exceed $ 2.2 billion by 2012 ( Ministry of Health , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S As the population ages , the need for healthcare services will increase .\n",
      "S Public spending will keep increasing and should not be limited as the aging population in Singapore continues .\n",
      "S The increasing popularity of smaller , nuclear families and the trend of more individuals remaining single could raise the number of wholly-elderly households ( Singapore Department of Statistics , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S In addition , elderly are having higher life expectancies rate and living longer due to the advancement of medical healthcares and technologies .\n",
      "S This would imply that lots of public spending would be required to build an environment with suitable facilities for the elderly as more elderly will be living either alone or with their families around estates in Singapore .\n",
      "S Public spending will be required and should not be limited for modifications works such as lift upgrading projects that enable the lift to stop at every level of a flat .\n",
      "S Besides , lots public spending will be required for modifications works in neighbourhood estates such as building more railings and slopes with anti-slipped layer ( Tong , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S On the contrary , a neighbourhood could be specially developed with slopes , railings and lifts that cater to every floor of the flat .\n",
      "S This would help to limit the public spending on the elderly as the elderly can be grouped together and special needs will be cater for them in that neighbourhood .\n",
      "S More budgets could then be spent on other areas of Singapore 's development .\n",
      "S However , this would create an impression that the elderly are unwanted and left alone .\n",
      "S It also means that the government is encouraging elderly not to stay with their families .\n",
      "S Furthermore , modifying facilities such as lift to every floor of the flat , railing and slopes with anti-slipped feature not only benefits the elderly but also the handicapped and residents living in the estates .\n",
      "S It allows heavy and bulky items to be unloaded from a vehicle and deliver to our house using slopes and lift without much carrying activities need to be done .\n",
      "S People should see these modifications as assets to the neighbourhood estates rather than expenses spend on the elderly .\n",
      "S Therefore public spending should not be limited as old-aged elderly will eventually be spread out across Singapore due to increasing aging population and eventually all flats will require a lift that serve every floors if not alternate floors and elderly-friendly facilities which can be beneficial to all .\n",
      "S In conclusion , fertility rates are declining while life expectancies are increasing around the globe .\n",
      "S As a result , populations are aging rapidly and Singapore is not exempted from this trend .\n"

      "S Every government makes a great number of efforts to bring more benefits to the public , such as giving them much more welfare , better lives , higher living standard , etc .\n",
      "S However , it is when people can prolong their life-span that governments need to pay attention to another difficulty - the social influences of the aging population .\n",
      "S There is a controversial issue that how much governments should invest in this matter .\n",
      "S Despite the fact that many people approve the idea of unlimited budget for the old , it would be better to set a term to governments ' expenses in this problem for some reasons .\n",
      "S With respect to the overall social benefits for a country , investing into dealing with the aged problem is not as profitable as into some other domains .\n",
      "S Apparently , it is not the elderly but the young generation that is the \" future \" of a country .\n",
      "S When getting older and older , generally , people can not contribute to the development of their countries as much as the young do and it is the younger generation that will assume responsibility of consolidating the country 's powers as well as enhancing the nation 's status in the world .\n",
      "S Therefore , instead of spending too much on the old , the government 's budget should focus on the collective who will decide the future of their states .\n",
      "S At this point , one may wonder that the old people did contribute to the improvements of their countries in the past , consequently , they deserve the government 's regard at their old age and if the governments ignore this problem , the next generations may not be willing to devote their ability to those who will make their contributions oblivious .\n",
      "S It should , however , be emphasized that the governments do pay attention to the aged population and what mentioned here is limiting the spending on this matter in a reasonable way .\n",
      "S The article Help the aged ( 2009 ) stressing that \" the budget must not forget older people \" even when governments are in difficult financial situation one more time provides evidence to confirm this argument .\n",
      "S In other words , governments highly appreciate the contribution of old people in the past and try to offer them more but the budget constraint calls for limiting in order to develop other aspects of society .\n",
      "S From the elder 's point of view , the more public expenses governments spend for them , the better the situation is .\n",
      "S By contrast , in terms of social influences , the spending should be restricted to some extent .\n",
      "S Imagine the scenario that government 's spending on the old people can expand as long as the demand of older people , successive negative influences will arise .\n",
      "S For instance , people will find that there is no need to concern themselves with their old - age lives because the governments will ensure that , therefore they will completely live on public welfare at the old age .\n",
      "S Moreover , individuals ' demand is limitless ; so , the governments can not afford their entire requirements .\n",
      "S As a result , the ever-growing of older people 's dependence on the governments may lead to unexpected problems thereafter such as overspending on this matter and lack of budget to invest in other fields to develop countries .\n",
      "S The Strategy for Older People ( Welsh Assembly Government , 2003 ) also approved that the spending for the old should be limited so that the budget can be balanced for many issues of a nation and it is considered as the strategy for long-term development of every country .\n",
      "S Certain objections must , of course , be considered that the expenses for old people need to expand according to the higher living standard as well as the increasing expenditure in modern society .\n",
      "S However , it should be aware that the problem lies on the definition of \" limited \" .\n",
      "S To most people , \" limited spending \" refers to a fixed amount of money by the time .\n",
      "S It is , however , maybe approached from another angle that a constant proportion of GDP of a country to support the old people is maintained .\n",
      "S In this case , when governments have budget to invest in other areas of the countries ' development , the economy operates well , the overall income of a country escalates ; the spending for old people will be put up as a result .\n",
      "S In conclusion , as for overall social influences , there should be a reasonable limitation in terms of spending for the old people so that the governments can balance their expenses for various problems of their countries .\n",
      "S The aged should also be aware of this situation , sympathetic with their governments and cooperate to deal with the relating difficulties .\n",
      "S With the great efforts of governments , individuals as well as an effective strategy for this problem , it is possible that the countries can achieve many targets at the same time : limited budget for old people , the approval of the aged and the development of their nations .\n",

      "S A government pension system , namely the National Pension ( NP ) which is financed in part by employee 's contributions and employer 's liability for general workers was introduced in 1988 for retirees over 60 ( \" Silver jobs in lieu of golden years , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S It is the main- old- age pension program covering the majority of Korean workers .\n",
      "S However , this policy executed by the government did not attain its goal when many of the retirees chose to take their pension in a lump sum at retirement .\n",
      "S This implies that the financial security for these elderly in the future will be strongly affected if they do not use their pension wisely .\n",
      "S Considering this matter , in 2004 , the National Pension Service started finding jobs for the elderly and the project was made permanent in 2006 .\n",
      "S There was an overwhelming result when job placements rose from around 30,000 in 2004 to more than 83,000 in 2006 and 196,000 in the first half of this year .\n",
      "S Despite this progress , there still are not enough openings for the baby boomers .\n",

      "S Social service programs have been introduced for the welfare of the elderly .\n",
      "S It can be divided into two groups , consisting of the recreational programs and community programs .\n",

      "S For example , under the community program , there is this sub- program called the Home- Help Program which provides home- help services to the elderly without any fees incurred .\n",
      "S Around 35,000 volunteer home helpers were active , linked to 552 voluntary organizations in 2001 with the provision of government in financial assistance for recruiting , training and maintaining volunteers .\n",
      "S Although many beneficial services has been provided to the elderly , this program still does not seem to be so effective as volunteers may or may not render their services whenever the elderly need them .\n",
      "S It is not a mandatory or binding issue for them to always lend a hand to the elderly .\n",
      "S Therefore , the government should think of a better way to tackle this problem so that the society will have a concept that their voluntary work is not an optional choice , but a domestic routine to serve the elderly who need their assistance .\n",
      "S Due to the low fertility rate and the growing of elderly in the society , there is a shortage of workforce in certain occupations .\n",
      "S To keep an ideal and constant working age group ( 15-64 years ) and ensure the stability of manpower in Korea , the government has been inviting immigrants to join the workforce .\n",
      "S The number of foreign labors has grown from a few thousand to estimates of 168 thousand in 1999 ( Bureau of Medium- Sized Industries , 1999 ) and 358 thousands in 2005 .\n",
      "S This replacement migration in coping with the population in Korea has not only helped to ease the ageing process when the older Koreans started to retire which resulted in certain downfalls of manpower in certain specialization , it also has helped to buffer the current shortage of labor in the market .\n",
      "S Unfortunately , the idea did not seem to give only positive impacts , but also negative consequences when there are around 65 percent of the immigrants imported in 1999 are working illegally ( Bureau of Medium- Sized Industries , 1999 ) .\n",
      "S The large volumes of immigrants to fill up the labor shortage due to population aging also arouse fears of loss of national identity ( UN , 2000 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , even though the adoptions of the immigrant policy have helped to ease the ageing process , it might not be the best policy to conquer this matter .\n",

      "S Thirdly , limiting public spending can lead to problems more grave than what we are currently dealing with .\n",
      "S Let us suppose that the government uses means-testing to limit spending on the elderly , the old people outside the vulnerable sub-groups will either have to continue to work , or rely on their savings or their children 's support to live on .\n",
      "S In the current situation , when the economic crisis is still not over yet and ageism is still present in workplace , old people are less likely to get a good job .\n",

      "S Their children who before only had to support themselves and their own children now also have to take care of their parents ' well-being .\n",
      "S With all the extra expenses , the children may not be able to save up for their own retirement .\n",
      "S This will result in an inescapable and cruel cycle of life which can only be resolved by reverting the policy back to the original one and at the same time , creating a shock on the economy from the abrupt change in budget distribution .\n",
      "S Another point is that , in a country with a growing aging population , the elderly make up a substantial part of the population , hence play a bigger role in decision-making on the country 's many issues .\n",
      "S The country 's social stability will inevitably be disrupted if such policy is applied forcibly without any consent from the elderly .\n",
      "S Another argument advocating the limitation on budget for the old is that it is better to increase the wealth of the country by investing on the younger generation , which will be the future workforce of the country , and temporarily spend less on the elderly , who left , or will sooner or later leave the workforce .\n",
      "S However , in times of difficulties , old people have no one but their families and relatives to rely on , and we are back in the situation we discussed above .\n",
      "S Furthermore , this strategy does not solve anything since the money diverted to other sectors , which may reduce the expenses of working people , indirectly becomes the money spent on the elderly , which is the new burden imposed on the people in the workforce .\n",
      "S In conclusion , we should not limit spending on the aged because it is our way to express our thanks to their contributions to the society , it is to allow the under-privileged old people to live on and it is to maintain the economic and social stability .\n",
      "S Global aging population is one of the most critical and pressing issues that the leaders of the twenty first century face .\n",
      "S According to the United Nations report , the proportion of population aged 60 or above in the developed and less developed countries is projected to reach 33 % and 25 % respectively by 2050 ( United Nations , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S The change in the age structure of a country 's population will has a profound impact on the political , social and economical conditions of that country .\n",
      "S In view of the increasing number of elderly , governments across the globe have implemented various policies to help them cope with the aging process .\n",
      "S Aging process here refers to the problems that will come about as one grows old , such as healthcare issues , financial problems and many more .\n",
      "S Although there are already policies in place , much changes and improvements have to be done to effectively help the elderly address their growing concerns and improve their quality of life .\n",
      "S Advocate of government policies often argue that many countries have provided financial security and support for the aged through policies such as social pension and compulsory savings ( Wesumperuma , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S While this may be true , such measures are ineffective in reducing old-age poverty as many elderly have little understanding of how the system work and do not possess the necessary financial knowledge to manage their savings and allowance .\n",
      "S As such , government has to put more emphasis and effort to impart financial education and provide money advice and information to help the elderly better finance their savings and incomes .\n",
      "S Due to the complexity of these policies , some elderly do not even know how to use them to their benefits , hence rendering them worthless .\n",
      "S In addition , a study by ( Age UK ,2009 ) shows that old people often do not know how to optimize their savings and spend their money carelessly .\n",
      "S As a result , their savings and incomes are exhausted quickly .\n",
      "S In another separate study by ( Chu &Yuen , 2008 ) , it is stated that around 67 % of the respondent think that the compulsory saving in Hong Kong can not provide them with a happy retirement life as they do not understand about the benefits of Mandatory Provident Fund ( MPF ) scheme and hence do not care about it .\n",
      "S Therefore it is necessary that the government highlight the availability and benefits of their financial policies and equip the aged with basic financial education to increase the effectiveness of these policies .\n",
      "S Secondly , there is a need to increase the efficiency of the social and health care system by curbing the rising cost of health care service and making it more accessible to the aged .\n",
      "S Critics of this position often point out that there are already established health care system and policies in place to subsidise the cost of health care and that changes are frequently introduced to improve them .\n",
      "S Despite the changes that are implemented , such measures are insufficient to help the aged as the root problems of rising cost and increasing inaccessibility are not addressed .\n",
      "S As pointed out by Tanner ( 2008 ) , rising health care cost is a global phenomenon .\n",
      "S Costly health care system is highly unsustainable as it strains government budget and imposes a great burden on the aged and their families ' finances .\n",
      "S As a result , the savings and the income of the elderly may be used up quickly or large portion of their finances have to be spent on health care services .\n",
      "S One possible solution is to encourage people to buy more health insurance ( University of Maine , 2001 ) .\n",
      "S Many elderly are uninsured as they fail to realise that many of the illness that can be prevented or treated cheaply in the early stages very often worsen into critical conditions .\n",
      "S In addition , although there are health care system in place , there are still many who do not have access to them .\n",
      "S This is due to the confusing systems that access elderly base on ambiguous criteria that makes it harder for them to obtain the service and simply lack of information and advice ( Help The aged we will , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Hence , containing rising health care cost and increasing accessibility are essential to help ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Lastly , more should be done to increase the labour participation rate of the aged in the workforce .\n",
      "S An argument against this is that adequate effort has been put in to encourage later retirement and longer working lives .\n",
      "S Despite the effort , employment level of the aged still remain low as the elderly continue to face discrimination at work .\n",
      "S Older workers are often viewed as less dynamic and less creative as compared to the younger workers , thus they are less preferred .\n",
      "S Unless there is a change in attitude towards the older workers , it will be difficult for them to be find jobs , which can keep them active and support their financial needs .\n",
      "S Discrimination towards the older workers is more evident during the recession .\n",
      "S There was a 46 % increase in the number of unemployed people in the UK whereas the biggest increase is those aged 60 and above with an increase of 65 % ( Wallop , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S A possible solution for this is to scrap national default retirement age which often give the power to employers to retrench those above this retirement age .\n",
      "S Also the government can give benefits or incentives to older workers to encourage them to go for re-training in order to increase their employability .\n",
      "S Employment can reduce elder dependency and provide some financial support for the aged to finance some of their activities .\n",
      "S In conclusion , current policies are inadequate in allowing the elderly to retire happily .\n",
      "S Changes should be made to the current financial , health care and employment policies for the aged so that they can better help the elderly .\n",

      "S Public spending is the amount of taxation collected by the government to provide services for its people such as education , health care and law and order maintenance .\n",
      "S The dominating population in countries that are experiencing growing aging population is the elderly citizens because the demographic trends change had led rapid increment of the seniors rather than the young ones .\n",
      "S If the number of elders continues to increase , pertinent problems will definitely escalate .\n",
      "S Therefore , government should spend more on the aged not only to ease their aging process but also to tackle problems arising from a growing population .\n",
      "S Despite the government consistent spending on the old , public spending on the aged should not be limited but should be used accordingly based on the circumstances .\n",
      "S First , it is a social obligation to provide for the seniors .\n",
      "S They are the ones who have contributed to the development of the country in the first place .\n",
      "S They should at least be compensated for the efforts put in for the younger generations to live more comfortably .\n",
      "S If the government were to place a limit of its spending on the aged , the aged will have to go through more difficult aging process as there wo n't be sufficient provisions for the elders to live more comfortably especially when one country is experiencing a huge demographic change where there is more aged living in the society .\n",
      "S It may be objected that despite great accommodation , there may be some elders who have not contributed to the society at all and worse so they took advantages of the provisions given to them .\n",
      "S However , the elders constitute only a small portion of the whole aging population .\n",
      "S As asserted by Sol de Saca ( 2008 ) , the government should incorporate the needs of the older people in social policy designs and make them the first priority .\n",
      "S In order to ensure that , despite their different behaviours , the government have to generalise them as a whole and place more focus on their living .\n",
      "S Second , the elders will be the ones contributing the most in the near future .\n",
      "S Increasing spending on them will lead to increasing benefits for the country in the future .\n",
      "S Supported by AARP report ( 2007 ) , most Singaporean opinion leaders consider population aging as an opportunity to create new roles for the elderly .\n",
      "S The government should therefore focus more on the older people by providing them more training and sufficient provisions .\n",
      "S In spite of the elders ' willingness to work , the employers may not want to take them in as supported from the statistics retrieved from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( 2000 ) : the forecasted number of people being employed for every person in year 2030 is 2 in Japan and 2 in Canada .\n",
      "S The reason may be the older people are not as productive and employers may not be prepared to take in these elderly citizens ( AARP 2007 ) .\n",
      "S However , Angel Gurria , ( 2008 ) cited that in an era of rapid population aging , employers can no longer afford policies , employment practices and attitudes that discourage work at an older age .\n",
      "S This shows that employers will have to resort in employing the aged .\n",
      "S Thus , it will be prudent for the government commence its course of actions earlier before the situation become worse .\n",
      "S The aged are not able of depending on young adults .\n",
      "S As Molina ( 2007 ) stated , the present-day adults are having increasingly fewer children , and thus , there will be increasingly fewer young people to care for their parents in their older years .\n",
      "S Due to that , the government is advised to lend a hand in helping them and by limiting its spending does not assist the aged .\n",
      "S However , one may argue that the elders maybe old but they have full capabilities to care for themselves .\n",
      "S From a news in Japan ( Reuters , 2007 ) , an old man passed away in his apartment for 3 years and no one knew about I until the landlord was prompted to visit him .\n",
      "S In view of that , it 's known that the elderly ca n't really manage themselves especially when they are getting older , with worn-out body and frequent ailments visiting them .\n",
      "S If nothing 's to be done to protect them , the aged will continue suffer and the situation may even worsen in the next few decades .\n",
      "S I it will help reduce the burden on the younger generations as they do not have to worry of their parents ' well-beings when the government put more emphasis in favour of the aged .\n",
      "S Lee ( 2009 ) have provided suggestion of helping the elders to become more self-reliant through various implementations of policies such as providing the elders with better health care and jobs to support them financially .\n",
      "S By doing so , the younger ones will be more stress-free and it will be more conducive for them to concentrate on doing their jobs which will in turn help develop the country and probably even increase the birth rate .\n",
      "S However , by doing so , it will increase the dependency of the young adults on the government to help support their parents .\n",
      "S They will begin to neglect their parents and forget about filial obligations to their parents .\n",
      "S What is recommended is the government should probably help only those elders whose children are not financially capable of supporting their parents .\n",
      "S To ensure effectiveness , the government may have to create a new policy stating that those children who have stable income of certain amount have to take care of their parents .\n",
      "S By doing so , the government is able to concentrate on those who really require the aiding .\n",
      "S The elders should not be treated as mere importance to the country 's welfare .\n",
      "S In Singapore Country Report ( 2007 ) , it was shown with statistics that the most prominent problem economic challenges in the next 20 years are posted by an aging of the population which constitutes 69 % .\n",
      "S This proves that the future is dependent on how well the government incorporate policies to support the aged .\n",
      "S Furthermore , the Japanese are even resorting to the help of robots to support the aging population and cope with the declining labour force ( Reuters , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S The government is able to buffer the effects if the government place more attention on the aged .\n"

      "S Hence , the government should be advised to continue providing for the aged , trying to overcome the obstacles presented and thus increase the provision whenever needed .\n",
      "S There are always some controversies over the aging future which is one of the most concerning subjects nowadays .\n",
      "S Some people think about it as a burden to national economy which is to spend a lot on pension as well as health issues while other people of pessimistic opinion argue that old people have the right to enjoy public money .\n",
      "S From my point of view I strongly agree with the idea which encourages government to reduce the amount of money spent on the aged for some reasons .\n",
      "S The very first and most striking point to note is that the economy of world is suffering from many depression as well as recession and the most recent period occurred from 2008 to first 6 months of 2009 .\n",
      "S It means that it will be a burden for the government to keep financing the pension or taking care of all the olds expenditure such as in health issues and in accommodation .\n",
      "S And to be specific , I think there are also many different important fields that also need a lot of government aid such as education or children 's upbringing which will definitely have a considerable influence on the country 's future .\n",
      "S Secondly , there should be family 's responsibility in taking care of the old so that the government can have more time and money to spend on other fields .\n",
      "S For examples in some Asian countries such as Vietnam or Japan , their children are very willing to take care of their old parents till the end of their life to reciprocate , which is a kind of common moral principles in Asian culture .\n",
      "S Moreover nowadays there are many blue-collar jobs which are impliedly reserved for old people to earn a living .\n",
      "S By saying that I mean old people themselves somehow can earn money to live on .\n",
      "S For instance , by observing I can see that almost the blue-collar workers in Singapore are about over fifty .\n",
      "S Even though there are some people argue that old people have the right to use the government financial aid because they have paid tax , I personally think they as well as their children have also benefited from tax such as transportation , education , etc .\n",
      "S In short , I think not only government but also family will have the responsibility to take care of old people so that public budget will be spent on many different areas to develop country and we all can enjoy life with a higher living standard .\n",
      "S It is well known that our society is aging .\n",
      "S Our Government has played a huge role in implementing and improving our policies to maximize the aid for the elderly .\n",
      "S However , there will always be persisting problems that the government will face such as National budget and economies coming under pressure , rising cost in the medical field and providing safety aids and measures in public areas .\n",
      "S Thus , current research and development in these areas are required to further ease the problems .\n",
      "S National budget and the economy have come under pressure as government provides heavy subsidies to the elderly in medical , transportation and even social activities .\n",
      "S Some might think that rather having to research and develop better economic policies , the government should just allocate this money for elderly benefits .\n",
      "S However , we should not just blindly put these money into subsidies , instead , we can use it to research for better policies or systems that will maximize the utility of the budget .\n",
      "S Having better policies , the government will be able to increase the productivity of the work force .\n",
      "S When productivity increases , economic growth will also follow .\n",
      "S There will be more money generated and fewer people in need .\n",
      "S One example would be that the government implemented the \" Foreign Talent Policy \" , which opened our market to foreign talents and thus increasing the productivity of the workforce .\n",
      "S Besides having greater productivity , the government introduced a scheme that allows people to provide in advance for their old age dependency .\n",
      "S They are encouraged to save a portion of their salary into a special account when they are most active in the workforce .\n",
      "S In Singapore , this particular self-funded retirement scheme is called \" CPF Contributions \" .\n",
      "S This is where the employer and employee have to provide monetary contributions for that particular employee 's CPF account .\n",
      "S Apart from this , there are additional or related schemes such as Medisave and Medishield .\n",
      "S Britain , Australia , Chile have also moved towards this kind of funded retirement schemes .\n",
      "S Therefore , current research in development and policies in the economy sector do help in easing the aging process .\n",
      "S In the medical aspect , it may be objected that no medicine in the world can cure aging illnesses such as Dementia and Arthritis .\n",
      "S Even though that is a fact , advancement in the medical field has proven to pro-long and even cure some old age diseases like Cataracts .\n",
      "S Constant research in this field has better prepared the elderly in terms of knowledge , treatments and physical conditions in relation to these diseases .\n",
      "S With prior knowledge , people will be mentally prepared for the aging process .\n",
      "S In addition , they can seek treatments in the early stages to prevent worsening of the conditions or even get cured .\n",
      "S This will also in turn save huge amount of money for the people , as later treatments will require one to pay a higher price .\n",
      "S Knowing the symptoms of a disease does help too .\n",
      "S One example is that when an elderly is having doubled or blurred vision , sensitivity to light and glare , he or she might be having cataract .\n",
      "S Thus they can seek treatment or go for a cataract surgery if needed .\n",
      "S Research and developments have also seen implementation of the latest technologies being used in hospitals , clinics and some even at home .\n",
      "S New age technologies like these have helped doctors to react within precious seconds in saving a person 's life .\n",
      "S They can also assess the their patient 's condition in a shorter and more accurate time frame .\n",
      "S For example , elderly with high blood pressure can check their blood pressure anytime and anywhere with just a push of the button on a compact , portable blood pressure monitor .\n",
      "S Thus , all these research in medical field has aided the aging process tremendously .\n",
      "S From the medical sector , we have learnt that prevention is better then cure .\n",
      "S With that , architecture too has moved towards a more elderly-savvy approach in buildings and public areas to prevent unwanted accidents .\n",
      "S At this point , one may wonder that it is a waste of resources to invest in architectural aids because these structures are costly and does n't serve as much purpose compared to the other sectors such as medical .\n",
      "S However , these aids have proven to be essential despite the costly structures .\n",
      "S In populated elderly areas such as Redhill or Tiong Bahru , railings have been installed not only on pavements but in public toilets as well .\n",
      "S Tiles or pavements with better friction have been placed in toilets to prevent elderly from slipping .\n",
      "S In addition , one of the major projects that Singapore 's Ministry of Transport has developed was to install lifts in almost every MRT stations , creating a barrier free route .\n",
      "S All these developments do not only help the elderly but also the disabled and pregnant women as well , thus developments in these area is definitely worthwhile .\n",
      "S In conclusion , all the research and developments and policies the government has invested in have made aging a more joyous and less terrifying journey .\n",
      "S Thus , current research , development and policies in the economy , medical sector and architectural sector have helped to ease the aging process to a large extent .\n",
      "S One of the biggest issues the world is facing now is the problem of an aging population .\n",
      "S Thus , there are an increasing number of concerns as to how to solve the problems of an aging population .\n",
      "S One of the most direct ways of dealing with the problems is to divert more government spending to the aged .\n",

      "S By directing more funds to the aged , there will be lesser funds for other areas of the country 's development .\n",

      "S The life today is very much different from the past .\n",
      "S The advances in research and development have made it possible to cure illnesses that are otherwise deadly .\n",
      "S For instance , according to the Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports ( MCYS , 2009 ) in Singapore , the percentage of residents aged 55 years and above who are physically independent are as high as 92.2 % in year 2005 .\n",
      "S This means that they are capable of finding a job to support themselves and not depending on others .\n",
      "S This is also proven by the fact that the Ministry of Manpower ( MOM , 2009 ) increased the retirement age in Singapore from 55 to 62 and the age is still expected to increase to 65 by year 2012 .\n",
      "S More elderly are now able to participate in the workforce actively .\n",
      "S Minimum help should be required from the government and so public spending on the aged should be limited .\n",

      "S If the government spending on the aged is not limited , the other sectors will be neglected .\n",

      "S \" Aging \" is defined as the process of becoming old .\n",
      "S ( Oxford University Press , 2005 ) Hence , easing the aging process would mean making the course towards old age an enjoyable and less tedious one for the elderly .\n",
      "S In Singapore context , she has many different approaches in place and the few main ones include the implementation of Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , development and improvement made to the existing healthcare system and elder-friendly infrastructure and the implementation of Tax Relief Scheme .\n",
      "S All these have indeed helped to alleviate the aging process and allow the elderly to enjoy their sunset years to the fullest .\n",
      "S CPF in Singapore has played a crucial role in helping to reduce the fiscal cost of elder dependency as it compels citizens to save in advance for their old age .\n",
      "S ( Central Provident Fund [ CPF ] Board , 2009 ) Critics of this plan have debated that it is unsuitable as high costs of living makes it difficult for people to save more of their earnings for their pensions .\n",
      "S Thus it is incapable in helping to relieve the financial burden of the elderly .\n",
      "S However , this may not be true as with judicious planning on their spending , it is not impossible for them to save more while they are still active in the work force and be financial independence in old age .\n",
      "S Also , other social issues associated with aging population like declining birth rate and people living longer have indicated that there will be fewer working adults available to contribute to the society and to support the aged .\n",
      "S Therefore , this has increased the significance of CPF as it compels people to save in advance lest they are unable or have no one to support them during their old age .\n",
      "S Furthermore , CPF has helped to rule out the possibilities of younger generations neglecting about the importance of saving for their old age and preparing inadequately for their pensions .\n",
      "S Hence , CPF has indeed helped to ease the aging process and the financial burden of the elderly as it requires people to save in advance and also informs citizens on how much they should save in order to be self- sufficient for their old age .\n",
      "S This instils people with a sense of security in the sunset years as they are now more able to enjoy without much financial burden .\n",
      "S Apart from CPF , development and improvement made to the existing healthcare system and elder-friendly infrastructure have also eased the problem of disabilities and old-age illnesses .\n",
      "S It may be objected that these actions are superficial and inadequate as they do not directly deal with the problems related to old age ; therefore are unable to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S However , this may not be the case as with improved healthcare system , it does help to benefit the elderly and their healthcare needs will be better taken care of .\n",
      "S An example will be the introduction of more community hospitals to provide better and affordable healthcare services to the elderly .\n",
      "S Besides , with the development of more elder-friendly infrastructure within the community , this implies that the community will become barrier-free , safer and more conducive for the elderly .\n",
      "S One of such project is the lift upgrading programme .\n",
      "S ( Lee , 2009 ) The improved lifts will stop on every floor and this will be able to better cater to the needs of the elderly .\n",
      "S Additionally , to allow the aged to move about conveniently , many places including public transportations have been made wheel-chair accessible .\n",
      "S Hence , with a safer environment and with the provision of elder-friendly infrastructure and unhindered access to the public facilities , these have allowed the elderly to move about freely and enjoy their old age , thereby easing the aging process .\n",
      "S Implementation of Tax Relief Scheme such as Aged Parent Relief is also an important step to improve the retirement security as they encourage children to take care of their parents , thereby easing the aging process .\n",
      "S ( CPF , 2009 ) At this point , one may take advantage of this scheme to claim the tax reliefs for own use as it is nearly impossible for the government to keep track of where the money is spend on .\n",
      "S Thus the elderly parents may not be at the receiving end .\n",
      "S While this may indeed happen , the government has taken a further step to discourage this from happening .\n"

      "S ( Hobbs , 1993 , 25-1104 ) This will translate into the rising funding so as to provide care for this group of people .\n",
      "S On top of the money put aside into health care especially for the aged , barrier-free access like wheel-chair friendly roads and transportation system have to be set to accommodate to them .\n",
      "S To deal with these global aging problems , governments around the world have to reserve a large proportion of the already limited public spending for elderly .\n",
      "S This result in reduction of the government budget for the country 's development in both economically and socially .\n",
      "S The fund used on the elderly could otherwise be spent on allowing the country to have better economic growth by building better infrastructure for the commerce , industries and an improved education system .\n",
      "S In this way , the general population will be able to benefit from the increased in income as a result of the economic growth .\n",
      "S On the other hand , it is not morally right to leave the aged to fend for themselves especially they had contributed in one way or the other to the country 's development in their younger days , so they should rightfully enjoy the fruits of their labour .\n",
      "S It is true that the government should reward the aged for their contributions , but in order for the country to continue enjoying sustained growth , the public spending have to be diverted to other areas of the country 's development .\n",
      "S In addition , the responsibility of supporting the elderly does not only lay on the shoulders of the government , the elder themselves should plan for their retirement when they are still economic active .\n",
      "S This is done by implementing policies like the Medisave system , where Singaporeans have to put aside a certain percentage of their income into the Medisave account .\n",
      "S ( Central Provident Fund ) This system is to ensure that the senior citizen will be able to live on their own savings in the Medisave account .\n",
      "S Not only that , the children should also be show filial piety for their aged parents .\n",
      "S In cases , where the elderly are childless or physically ill due to aging , then it will be the government 's duty to take care of them .\n",
      "S However , in contrary to what common perspective of the elderly is , Pat Thane argued that , they are not inevitably unhealthy .\n",
      "S As the living conditions improve and technology advances , people are able to lead a healthier lifestyle and live longer as compared to the past .\n",
      "S Thane also cited that \" evidence that many tasks can be performed as well by people in their seventies as by younger people , even when they involve quite heavy physical or intellectual demands .\n",
      "S \" ( Thane,1991 ) As a result of the above mentioned arguments by Pat Thane , the Senior lecturer in Social Science and Administration at Goldsmiths College , London , and old age might not necessarily translate to being a burden to the society .\n",
      "S The elderly , especially the \" young elderly \" , can surely be able to earn a living on their own if they do not have the luxury of their children supporting them .\n",
      "S Therefore , an aging population might not posing problems as feared .\n",
      "S In summary , public spending on the aged should be limited because the fact that the elderly should have planned for their old age when they were young and they might still be able to support them if the need arises .\n",
      "S Concluding this , the country will be able to progress if their citizen do their part in planning for their retirement and , or their children supporting them .\n",
      "S Many countries are currently experiencing aging population which leads to a series of related economic and social problems .\n",
      "S For instance , workforce gets smaller as elder workers retire and working class have to pay more taxes due to the slower economic growth and the need to provide more healthcare services for the aged .\n",
      "S Even though the world is facing aging population , public spending should not only be spent on the aged as there are many other factors that need to be taken care of in the country 's future development .\n",
      "S Aging population is already an inevitable problem in many countries such as Japan and Singapore .\n",
      "S Therefore , public spending had been reviewed to address this problem and it helps to reduce the negative impact of aging problems to the society .\n",
      "S However , due to the practical reasons , a country has its limitations on supporting the aged .\n",
      "S Hence , countries should assess other important areas that public spending should be focused on as well .\n",
      "S On the other hand , if public spending on the aged were reduced , many social problems would arise in the country .\n",
      "S As the aged are used to receiving allowances and subsidies , the lack of government aids might affect their well-being .\n",
      "S They would be unable to support themselves especially with the increasing level of healthcare costs .\n",
      "S According to the Singapore Department of Statistics , the Consumer Price Index for healthcare had an increase of 3.6 % from February 2008 to February 2009 .\n",
      "S This would translate to higher costs of living for the aged .\n",
      "S Therefore , in this case , moral issues need to be considered as well .\n",
      "S Children of the aged should do their part in taking care of their parents after their retirement .\n",
      "S In conservative countries such as Singapore , children are expected to take care of their parents by providing them with allowance to meet their daily needs .\n",
      "S Children should remember how their parents have taken care of them when they are young and hence , should do their part in demonstrating the value of filial piety and take care of their aged parents , instead of relying on the country to help .\n",
      "S In order to ensure that the aged are properly taken care of by their children , government could introduce policies and enforce it on all .\n",
      "S This would help to enforce the emphasis government places on moral values and also directly reduce public spending , which could be diverted to other areas of development .\n",
      "S Other areas of development included addressing social issues such as the decrease in the birthrate and the increase in child abuse cases .\n"

      "S In Singapore , the Marriage and Parenthood package with the extension of the Baby Bonus only attained marginal success in increasing the birthrate of Singaporeans .\n",
      "S Median age of citizen mothers at first birth had increased over the years from 28.6 in 1998 to 29.4 in 2008 , thus causing the fertility rate for the prime childbearing age group of 20 to 34 to decline .\n",
      "S Hence , public spending could be used to introduce more programs and subsidies to encourage having larger families instead .\n",
      "S With increased birthrate , Singapore would be able to resolve the problem of aging population in the near future .\n",
      "S Besides aging population , other social issues such as child abuse are also crucial problems that need to be addressed .\n",
      "S According Social Statistics 2009 conducted by Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , the number of child abuse cases investigated in Singapore had increased from 154 in 2007 to 176 in 2008 .\n",
      "S This significant increase indicates that attention should be diverted to address this problem .\n",
      "S Public spending could be used to ensure that there are ways to reach out to the abused victims in the society .\n",
      "S In addition , it is essential to increase public awareness through campaigns and seminars to allow public to have a better understanding on child abuse .\n",
      "S With this , the society could play a part in creating a safer environment for children and hence , enhancing the social development in Singapore .\n",
      "S Even though many countries are facing aging population , there is a still a limit on what can be done .\n",
      "S Thus , countries should not be overwhelmed by the problems of aging population and overlook other potential problems .\n",

      "S Too much of the nation 's budget is spent on aiding the elderly and the government should limit and channel these funds to other more important areas for country 's development .\n",
      "S For most countries , part of their national budget will be spent on funding the aged each year .\n",
      "S For example , $ 121million is set aside as Senior Citizen Bonus in Singapore this year ( Budget Highlights , 2009 ) .\n",
      "S The elderly receive subsidies in various areas such as housing and medical subsidies .\n",
      "S As the elderly today are able to survive without subsidies from the government , these funds should be put to better use and be directed to support the country 's development .\n",
      "S The society has stressed on the importance of filial piety which requires children to take care of their parents .\n",
      "S Children are obliged to take care of their parents and this will lessen the burden on the society to take responsibility for the well-being of the elderly .\n",
      "S Thus , less funds are needed to help these elderly .\n",
      "S Excess funds should then be channeled to other areas for country 's development .\n",
      "S Many may think that with the obligation to support their parents , the working family members will bear a heavier burden to provide for their parents .\n",
      "S However , providing for the parents is not an additional burden for the children as benefits are reaped when they take care of their parents .\n",
      "S For example , tax relief for adults who live with aged parents has been increased to $ 5000 and CPF Housing Grant Scheme to encourage young couples to stay near their parents ( \" Round Up Speech \" , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S Therefore , it is not true to say that the working adults bear a heavier burden from supporting their parents when government incentives are provided .\n",
      "S Hence , the government should limit the amount used to aid the elderly as their financial needs are taken care of by their own family members .\n",
      "S Elderly nowadays are able to support themselves .\n",
      "S Chan ( 1999 ) showed that elderly respondents with CPF accounts are significantly less likely to rely on children as their main source of financial support , evidence suggests that as CPF coverage widens , reliance on children will probably decrease .\n",
      "S The government has implemented policies to help citizens prepare for their retired life .\n",
      "S Policies such as compulsory CPF and Medisave savings both require citizens to set aside part of their salary to meet their future retired needs .\n",
      "S Even if the elderly can support themselves , some may argue that they pay taxes and should be allowed to use these funds set aside for them .\n",
      "S Funds directed to other areas for the country 's development will also benefit the society .\n",
      "S For example , the construction of handicapped-friendly ramps and upgrading of HDB flats ' lift to serve at all levels .\n",
      "S The taxes that they pay may be channeled to support these upgrading works and benefit everyone .\n",
      "S With these policies implemented by the government , the elderly do not need so much financial assistance to meet their needs .\n",
      "S Everyone should be responsible for their well-being .\n",
      "S The aged should still continue to work even beyond their retirement age when they are still capable of supporting themselves .\n",
      "S In recent years , the government have been promoting elder employment and raising the eligibility age for employment .\n",

      "S Others may think that the elderly have already contributed their share to the society and should now retire .\n",
      "S However , instead of letting them idle at home , the retired should be allowed back in the workforce and continue contributing to the economy .\n",
      "S Their contributions not only benefit themselves financially , they are also able to share their precious experiences with the apprentice .\n",
      "S With elderly returning to the workforce , they are less dependent on the government subsidies and thus , less funds should be set aside for the elderly .\n",

      "S ( Takayama , 2005 ) However , public spending should also be allocated to other areas of the country 's development such as education , small medium enterprises ( SMEs ) and infrastructure sector that would benefit the public and are effective in tackling the aging issues in the long run .\n",

      "S ( Ministry of Education , 2009 ) Nevertheless , educating the workforce , including the aged , on the importance of planning for retirement and continuous skills upgrading are also essential .\n",

      "S It can also be seen as an evidence of public spending .\n",
      "S In 2009 , Singapore Senior Minister of State for National Development announced that the government plans to spend between S $ 18 and S $ 20 billion on infrastructure projects and another S $ 15 to S $ 17 billion in 2010 and 2011 respectively .\n",
      "S Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted on the National Day Rally Speech 2009 that new general hospitals ( Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital ) would be built in response to the healthcare needs in Singapore , on top of that , there is also a need to build step-down care .\n",
      "S Twinning the current general hospitals with the community hospitals , which are run by charitable organizations , will make healthcare affordable for all , especially the aged .\n",
      "S For example , a bridge would be built to link Tan Tock Seng General Hospital to Ren Ci Community Hospital that enables the patient from Tan Tock Seng General Hospital who is stabilized to be moved to Ren Ci Community Hospital for recovery and pay lesser for the cost of healthcare .\n",

      "S Singapore uses only one-fourth of its taxes , which is about only $ 381 per capita on health and individuals pay for the rest .\n",
      "S ( Callick , 2008 ) This shows the importance of tackling the roots of the high cost of healthcare instead of using the public spending directly on the aged .\n",
      "S Aging issues are very complicated but not indomitable .\n",
      "S For all nations , wise planning on public spending and wise policy planning are very crucial as they influence one 's future .\n",
      "S ( Friedland and Summer , 2005 ) Creating welfare dependency on the government only solves the issues temporarily .\n",
      "S In order to prevent this , public spending on the aged should be limited .\n",
      "S Instead , it should be used on other areas of development to tackle the roots of the issues and improve the quality of life .\n",
      "S Public spending means expenditure by government , covering the military , health , education , infrastructure , development projects , and the cost of servicing ( paying off the interest on ) overseas borrowing .\n",
      "S Aging problem likely causes a substantial increase in public expenditure on health .\n",
      "S But the stable development of society as a whole needs the balance of public spending on all aspects .\n",
      "S Thus the government should be cautious in expanding spending in the aging population , taking into account the impact on economic growth .\n",
      "S Above all , many recent reports from developed countries have found that ageing will have only a small effect on the healthcare expenditure in future , thus spending on the aged can be limited within a certain small scope of the proportion of GDP .\n",
      "S For example , reports from the United Statesthe United Kingdom and Australia have reached similar conclusions .\n",
      "S There are two reasons why researchers have reached this conclusion .\n",
      "S Firstly , the older population is not spending a large proportion of the country 's GDP , and the fact is not simply that the relatively greater proportion of older people there is , the more spending is as a percentage of GDP .\n",
      "S For example , the Sweden and the Australia have similar health outcomes , as measured by life expectancy .\n",
      "S But in 2000 , 17.3 % of the Swedish population was aged 65 years or older ; it spent only 8.6 % of its GDP on health .\n",
      "S This is less than the 9.3 % spent by Australia in 2001-02 , when only 12.7 % of the population was 65 years or older .\n",
      "S Secondly , many countries have adopt effective strategies to make the effect of population ageing on health expenditure to be small and manageable , Here is some of the strategies : ( 1 ) stratify the old by age and sex ; ( 2 ) give the limited coverage of the public pension system , new means-tested benefit for the elderly to reducing poverty ; ( 3 ) increase transparency about self-employed income to ensure fairness in the financing of social insurance systems , including the new long-term care insurance .\n",
      "S But , the aging problem may be exaggerated , due to a variety of reasons .\n",
      "S Here I just give three of them .\n",
      "S First , the factors that increase the financial expenditure has been over-emphasized , while the factors that make it less is likely to be ignored .\n",
      "S It is true that older people use more healthcare than younger people and that the proportion of older people in the population is increasing , but there are some another elements reduced the overall incidence of ill health .\n",
      "S For example , the period between illness and death may become shorter , the prevention and population health initiatives , and the higher awareness on the health issues .\n",
      "S These factors do have a certain impact .\n",
      "S For example , the proportion of people in the UK who require help with activities of daily living in 1991 is half of that in 1976 .\n",
      "S Second , some group of people may , as the reasons for their positions or interests , require a significant increase in public spending on the aging population .\n",
      "S One group is the old .\n",
      "S Compared to long-term economic development they may more concern about their own welfare .\n",
      "S Another is the government .\n",
      "S Because of an increasing number of elderly voters , in order to win majority support , politicians may provide excessive benefits to the elderly .\n",
      "S The other is private medical institution .\n",
      "S If the government finds that aging is a heavy burden , it is bound to decrease the necessary public expenditure , thereby forcing more people to use private health institutions .\n",
      "S Third , some increasing fiscal spending due to other causes have been mistaken that it is caused by the aging population .\n",
      "S Here I list three of them .\n",
      "S Firstly , the cost of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic tests increases .\n",
      "S The report published by the Australian federal governmentfound that in the growth in federal government health spending over the last decade .\n",
      "S The 90 % was because of pharmaceuticals and diagnostic tests .\n",
      "S Secondly , new technology almost always increases more people spend more money on the health care .\n",
      "S Because the wound is small and low-risk surgical techniques has increased the number of people who can have such operations .\n"

      "S Thirdly , normal doctor 's prescription prefers newer and more inclined to expensive , but not necessarily more effective drugs .\n",

      "S Many countries including Singapore are facing the issue of the aging population .\n",
      "S There are many implications to this issue and one of such implication is that the spending by the government on the aged has increased in order to deal with this issue .\n",
      "S This affects the amount of available funds to spend on other areas of the country 's development such as the economy , education and infrastructure .\n",
      "S Thus , in today 's society , much has been debated on whether public spending should be limited so more money can be diverted to other areas for the country 's development .\n",
      "S In my own opinion , I agree to a large extent that public spending on the aged should be limited .\n",
      "S One of the reasons to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a greater need to spend money on education than on the aged .\n",
      "S For countries such as Singapore where labor is vital and is the only resource , spending on education is important for the future growth of the country .\n",
      "S Furthermore , in Singapore where it is currently experiencing low birth rate , developing education aspect for the young is crucial to ensure there will be sufficient of local talents in the future .\n",
      "S This is to ensure that Singapore will be able to stay competitive with other countries in the future .\n",
      "S Therefore , in the long run , spending on education will generate economic benefits for the country .\n",
      "S On the other hand , if this same amount of money is to be spent on the aged , there will be no economic benefits generated by them for the country .\n",
      "S Hence , if the government does not limit the spending on the aged , smaller budget will be left for developing education .\n",
      "S This may affects the country in long run .\n",
      "S It can also be argued that there is a greater need to spend on infrastructure development as it is an important area for a country development .\n",
      "S Limit spending on the aged means that there will be a larger amount of funds available to spend on infrastructure development .\n",
      "S This fund allows the country to develop proper infrastructure such as roads , electricity and even water supply to attract more foreign investors in setting up firms in the country .\n",
      "S Superior infrastructure attracts foreign investors in setting up business in the country as it reduces production cost and also increases accessibility for their business .\n",
      "S Attracting foreign investors is important as foreign investments contribute to the country economic development .\n",
      "S Therefore , if government spending on the aged does not limit but increases due to aging population issue , the budget on infrastructure development will be lesser and this may affect the country 's economic development negatively .\n",
      "S Another reason to limit public spending on the aged is that there is a need to set aside larger amount of money for economic area especially currently when there is global economic downturn .\n",
      "S As economy is a key area of a country development , government should spend more money on economic development in order to sustain a healthy economic growth .\n",
      "S In addition , a prosperous economy will leads to the increase of affluences .\n",
      "S This means that the burden of supporting the aged by the society will be lessen .\n",
      "S Thus , spending in the economy will bring beneficial for both the country and the aged in long run .\n",
      "S On the flip side , spending on the aged is as equally as important in spending on any other area for country development .\n",
      "S Limit spending on the aged does not mean that government should not spend on them .\n",
      "S As they are part of the country 's population , there is a social responsibility to take care of the aged .\n",
      "S Moreover , this group of elderly had work hard for years when they were young and had contributed to the economy and society .\n",
      "S From this essay , I conclude that there is a need to limit public spending on the aged as there are other areas that require money for the country 's development .\n",
      "S After all , the aged is not the only area that we should look into when deciding on the allocation of public spending .\n",

      "S The limit of public spending on the aged is important because it indirectly controls the funds which would be channeled into other areas of a country 's development .\n",
      "S This accounts for the dilemma in the amount of spending to be diverted towards the ageing society as many believe that money directed to boosting a country 's economic growth is more practical than spending it on an ageing population which offers no economic returns .\n",
      "S Hence , a country should decide on the level of limit of spending they want to commit on the ageing population as different levels would lead to different results .\n",
      "S For a country which places low limit on the public spending of the aged , the amount of investment being channeled into other areas of the country 's development would be lower than another with a higher limit on the public spending .\n",
      "S For example , Britain spends more on their ageing population as compared to America and their level of investment in research and development is lower than that of America .\n",
      "S However , this is not to say that the public spending on the aged is the sole factor for the cause of lower investments in other areas of a country 's development , it is only one of the many factors .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , it still affects the level of fund being diverted to a country 's development .\n",
      "S A low limitation limits the funds being diverted to other areas of the country 's development such as education , technology and economic investments .\n",
      "S This may result in a slowdown in the progress of a country because the progress of a country is dependent on its ability to keep up with the competitive global economy .\n",
      "S With less funds being pumped into areas such as technology and infrastructures , investments may flow out when other nations offer better incentives .\n",
      "S This would then lead to an overall fall in the revenue of a country which will translates to a drop in the public spending on the aged ( Weil : 1997 ) .\n",
      "S Thus , it can be seen that negative results are being achieved with neither the aging population nor the country 's economy benefitting from it .\n",
      "S However , it may be argued that countries such as Britain are still progressing well in the global economy despite a high level of spending on the aged population showing that a low limitation on public spending does not equate to a halt in the progress of a country .\n",
      "S In addition , the low level of limitation would mean that quality healthcare are being catered to the elderly as sufficient money are being invested in them , this may lead to a healthier ageing population which may then contain the spread of elderly illnesses ( Dunnell : 1995 ) .\n",
      "S This containment could possibly lead to a fall in money being diverted to the aged population as they are healthier now , hence increasing the funds being diverted to other areas of a country 's development .\n",
      "S On the other hand , a country with a high limitation of public spending on the aged means that more funds are being diverted to other areas on their country 's development .\n",
      "S For instance , Singapore spend approximately 9 million on her ageing population , encouraging elderly independence instead thus she has a greater amount of money to be diverted to other areas .\n"

      "S These are direct issues an economy has to face in order to curb social issues and if not treated , will likely incur greater losses for the governments .\n",

      "S Excess public spending only adds to the comfort of the aging population and does not effectively benefit the economy .\n",

      "S For instance , as more money is pumped into infrastructural development within a country , the industries benefit as lesser time for setting up plants , tax benefits and cheaper rental , drive costs of doing business down .\n",

      "S ( Singapore Budget , 2009 ) Let us just think about the money that is going to be spent on the elderly .\n",
      "S Now , the problem some may question is whether such expenditure is too much .\n",
      "S Why not use the money in other areas so that these areas can improve ?\n",
      "S However , we need to realize that the older population we are talking about here refers to people who are not only old ; they also do face certain difficulties in supporting themselves and require the help to get on better .\n",
      "S Thus , I do not think that we should limit the amount of money to be spent on the elderly .\n",
      "S As mentioned earlier , one reason why we should not limit the spending is that it may not be fair to the elderly when the public spending is limited as among the elderly , there may be people who are really in great need of the support from the government .\n",
      "S We do know that the older population has a higher chance of facing illness and inconvenience in their physical movements .\n",
      "S Furthermore , based on the Census 2000 data , in Singapore , we have 14 percent of the elderly who only live with their spouse and 12 percent of the elderly do not live with their immediate family .\n",
      "S ( 2000 ) These elderly are facing problems in their lives .\n",
      "S In this case , they may not have the financial ability to take care of themselves without the help from the government .\n",
      "S Hence , it is the government 's duty to come in and render the help to them instead of limiting the help they can receive .\n",
      "S Another reason why we should not limit the public spending on the older population is because of the fact that the phenomenon of ageing population is expected to continue growing .\n",
      "S By limiting it , the amount may not be able to cater to all needs in the future as the limit is set on the basis of the population at a particular time .\n",
      "S Yet over the years , when this group of people increases , especially in rather high rate , the amount needed will be more than the amount put aside then .\n",
      "S Limiting the spending then handicaps the whole system reaction to the increasing number .\n",
      "S Then again , there is always the opposite side to the issue .\n",
      "S Some people may critique that if we do not limit the amount we are spending on the elderly now , this amount will increase proportionately with the increasing number of the elderly in the future .\n",
      "S This will cause the proportion of the amount that will be left for developments in other areas to reduce in the future as well .\n",
      "S In an article in the Reuters , it is indeed believed that as the United States faces growing number of the older people , pension and healthcare services will be pushed up and thus , compelling major increases in public expenditure .\n",
      "S ( Maggie , 2009 )\n",
      "S However , I see the argument in the other way .\n",
      "S That is , the amount of money that the government can use for developments of other areas may not increase even after limiting the spending on elderly .\n",
      "S This is because in actual fact , the burden is shared by the families of the elderly as well as the government .\n",
      "S The government does not pay the full cost .\n",
      "S If we limit the amount the government pays , the additional cost falls on the shoulders of the family members which will then be shifted back to the government by family in other means .\n",
      "S ( Robert and Laura , 2005 ) Since no difference is expected , be it limiting the amount or not , we should try to reduce the pressure that will be felt by majorities in the future-having to pay for high expenses for the elderly at home .\n",
      "S After looking at both sides , we can see that the older population is not a small group of people and the number will continue to increase in number in the future .\n",
      "S Thus , to cater to the needs of the older population , which may also be the largest group of people within the country in the future , it is best not to limit the amount .\n",
      "S Instead , keeping it flexible , to be increased in times of great need will be a better choice .\n",
      "S Our society is aging .\n",
      "S Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing ( 2002 ) suggested , \" since year 1950 , the average life expectancy has increased by 20 years and is expected to extend a further 10 years by 2050 \" .\n",
      "S This increase in life expectancy has been said to be the result of better public health care and advances in medical care .\n",
      "S Governments , realizing that there will be profound consequences followed by this global demographic transformation , have now come out with different strategies and policies to ease the aging process .\n",
      "S Nevertheless , the effectiveness of current research and policies in helping to ease the aging process are doubted by the public .\n",
      "S In fact , it calls into the question whether the elderly really benefits from the policy implemented in the aspect of financial security , employment and living arrangements for elderly .\n",
      "S In terms of economics , old age financial support is the government 's main concern and therefore mechanism that provides citizens with financial security in old age has been introduced .\n",
      "S For instance , Central Provident Fund ( CPF ) , a comprehensive financial savings plan for the workers has been implemented in Singapore .\n",
      "S Although CPF was aimed to secure the retired elderly by providing income to support their basic need in old age , nonetheless , it has been accused for its deficiency .\n",
      "S Shantakumar 1999 , Asher 1996 and 1998 , Lee 1999 and 2001a , have pointed out the lack of universal coverage and the lack of adequacy of funds for retirement security in this CPF scheme , especially for the low-income elderly ( as cited in David R. Phillips and Alfred C.M .\n",
      "S Chan , 2002 ) .\n",
      "S Along with the criticism , recent National Survey of Senior Citizens 2005 ( Ministry of Community Development , Youth and Sports , 2005 ) showed that only 41.3 per cent of the elderly aged 55 and above had CPF savings and , of these , 61.6 per cent felt that their CPF savings were inadequate .\n",
      "S Meanwhile , in a study of Asia Times Online ( Megawati Wijaya , 2009 ) , it showed a recent survey found out less than 5 % of the current elderly population rely on CPF disbursements for their livelihood .\n",
      "S All of these prove the failure of CPF scheme in providing a secure future life for most of the elderly .\n",
      "S Apart from that , government 's initiative in raising the retirement age is also blamed to be not effective .\n",
      "S In Singapore , the retirement age for its citizens will be raised from 62 to 65 by 2012 and eventually to 67 along with the higher life expectancy of its ageing population ( Reuters - The Inquirer , 2007 ) .\n",
      "S It is undeniable that by increasing the retirement age , the elderly will be able to accumulate wealth and eventually the strain on finances in their drought years will be ease .\n",
      "S However , people should take note that the problem now is not about the mandatory retirement age of the elderly , but indeed the employability problem faced by the senior citizens .\n",
      "S Most of the elderly claimed that they could not find a job even though they have the willingness to extend their retirement age .\n"
